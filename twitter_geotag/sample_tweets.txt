1300497670096650246 2020-08-31 14:16:21 EDT <iam_gujju> They had different scenario. It wasn't global outage at all. They should have continued ‚úåÔ∏è but still respect for Armenia.. Such a strong team with Levon üî•
1300491720304390144 2020-08-31 13:52:42 EDT <TSS_Raj> (6) But don't be the sucker who buys on the split simply because the price dropped. Be smart, trade with a reputable broker who doesn't have outages and who will get you the stock at the price you see. Most brokerages don't have commission trade fees anymore either.
1300491305697644545 2020-08-31 13:51:03 EDT <nayeliiidiazzz> LOL professors are something else I had a professor who said to look at the weather forecast beforehand to avoid a power outage.

1300484811824349184 2020-08-31 13:25:15 EDT <MrPoopGaming> So just got off the phone with XFinity, apparently there's a massive internet service outage where I live... probably won't get fixed till this afternoon at the earliest. :/ We'll try again tomorrow! Really sorry guys, I feel awful...
1300479827179384832 2020-08-31 13:05:27 EDT <TestedSokr> I know! Also power outages aren‚Äôt uncommon here. They happen at least once a week here. I was really worried
1300473355582214144 2020-08-31 12:39:44 EDT <AnthonyPoirier1> @ATT any chance someone can tell me an ETR on the outage in my area? Getting tired of listening to my flat mates complaint about it for the past three hours.
1300471324175933442 2020-08-31 12:31:39 EDT <dkovacs2012> Because anybody can play online people want to have fun. You can't ever predict that something like this will happen a storm can happen and a power outage can happen at random moment internet companies can fuck you over any second

1300460680978587648 2020-08-31 11:49:22 EDT <PiPrimePi> I was pointing out the irony in the outage of 17 year old in our streets, but we are willing to send 18 year olds to foreign countries, to fight in those streets.    He was attacked. And acted in self defense from everything I have seen. He shouldn‚Äôt have been there at all.

1300458276098801665 2020-08-31 11:39:49 EDT <DwgpndSurf> I have Verizon and haven't had any issues. I'm also in Florida.  But we did receive an email at work that mentioned widespread outage issues impacting a lot of different types of services.  Don't know if it's a result of the hurricane blowing up through the states or what.
1300454006574198789 2020-08-31 11:22:51 EDT <kcmetrobus> We will ask them to look into this. Is it always the same RapidRide line, or different ones? We'd like to narrow it down so we can alert the vehicle maintenance team at that base. We don't have a report of wide-spread outages, so we like to be able to look at specific coaches.
1300445892168671233 2020-08-31 10:50:36 EDT <Midcontinent> Good morning! I know how important the internet is and I can definitely help. I don't see any outages nearby that should be causing trouble.

A map would be handy since your website says not to call & ask, & when I do call & ask they say "maybe" & "we don't have a status at this time". Is there ANY information at all for 27107 & whether there's an outage? Don't say sorry.

Being without power for 19 hours is maddening. Fingers crossed at this point that all our refrigerated/frozen food stuffs made it. Didn‚Äôt open anything.

1300243030176223232 2020-08-30 21:24:30 EDT <Martian_High> True. At least, so long as the majority of Americans can stay inside, have access to food and creature comforts, and aren't yet broke and on the edge of eviction.  But you know what doesn't go out in a power outage? Cell service. And at this point, it probably shouldn't go out.

1300124083984580609 2020-08-30 13:31:51 EDT <KICHUVINOD> I'll tell you what I meant by my tweet..Levon CLAIMED PUBLICLY that they proved the issue wasn't at their end..If the issue wasnt at their end, they shouldv been given a rematch. Global outage is just a cause for the DC to occur. It could be some server error somewhere local(1/2)
1300122163429609472 2020-08-30 13:24:13 EDT <KICHUVINOD> I don't care if there was a global outage..If the issue wasn't at Armenia's end, how would a global outage or a local outage for that matter make a difference?

They explicitly say it's part of their SLA (service level agreement) which means that if you pay for it, you get reimbursed for any slight outage (at the enterprise level, it's 25x reimbursement which is silly). And the reimbursement is automatic unlike others.
1300101238588088328 2020-08-30 12:01:04 EDT <davepdotorg> At least I know Pushover isn't affected by this outage...

1300088311722250242 2020-08-30 11:09:42 EDT <aptasi> A large scale internet outage started ~four hours ago, affecting many websites and service providers including Comcast, CenturyLink, AT&T, Level 3, Time Warner Telecom, Cogent, UUNet Verizon, Cox, Cloudflare, Google, Microsoft, and many more.    https://www.thousandeyes.com/outages¬†

1300081661925888001 2020-08-30 10:43:17 EDT <DadTheDM2> Woke up, it's my #birthday, still no internet. Made some coffee and forgot the creamer went bad in the outage. Walked 30 mins to the store to get creamer (fiance's at work with my truck) and they don't have any. Get a #javamonster instead. Trip on my way home and drop it opened.

1300073866904178692 2020-08-30 10:12:18 EDT <riskiing> I have no idea what I'm going to do when I get back. I'm running out of money to stay in Austin, and fast. I can't go back to my apartment or my parent's house, both are damaged plus this utility outage is  expected to last at least 6 weeks. I dont know what to do
1300072374147190786 2020-08-30 10:06:22 EDT <zzhenqtinq> Luckily I didn't have an outage at all though. For my fanmeet it was just the service and I lost an hour of it. But my internet was perfectly fine. For me it was the company of the group's fault. I'm sorry to hear this though :c having an outage sucks :c
1300067935453667333 2020-08-30 09:48:44 EDT <billythenerd3> What are you paying a month for AT&T Fiber? I‚Äôve been with Spectrum for a long time but recent outages are getting old. I‚Äôm considering switching.
1300067204512321536 2020-08-30 09:45:50 EDT <zzhenqtinq> Ahh so there was a kpop fanmeet going on and their server crashed for a lot of people worldwide, and some ignorant people were spreading lies saying "it's a personal issue and spectrum had outage on the east coast" when that wasn't true at all :c

1300059803625164815 2020-08-30 09:16:25 EDT <alannerd614> One would think, with all the money @Delta makes (at least prior to covid), an "internet outage" wouldn't prevent a plane from taking off.   Maybe have secondary connections, etc...
1300059775472992256 2020-08-30 09:16:19 EDT <DakotaJames6> Global outage for the internet, appears to be a problem with @centurylink . On a Sunday when absolutely no one is at their call centers to answer questions and apparently they can‚Äôt be bothered to use social media to explain or inform Us as to why.
1300056850621239298 2020-08-30 09:04:41 EDT <DeboostedLucy4> AT&T was down in my area for over 24 hours.  Error message was something about security. On their website, it said an outage affected 0-151 people.  When I called them, they said a line had been cut.
1300056270297161728 2020-08-30 09:02:23 EDT <Tellisaurus_Dex> We're now in hr number 3 of the net outage at my job. Haven't taken a call since about 3:15, it's now 6am.
1300050251332694016 2020-08-30 08:38:28 EDT <ToffeeSwirl> Twitch seems to be having issues this morning.  There are outages all over.  Haven't been able to watch any streams for at least an hour this morning.
1300048785293352960 2020-08-30 08:32:38 EDT <BigBroeyJoey> Isn't this the second time in a pretty short time that there is a big outage at cloudflare? Such a treat having so many sites using the same service üëå
1300039060023513091 2020-08-30 07:54:00 EDT <CCG_LV> @steveschorr Cox employees are saying they are doing the outage in purpose for customers to upgrade their service. They had me replace my modem to a panoramic last week, guess what? I don‚Äôt have Internet at all. This is a class action lawsuit waiting to happen.
1300037088621015040 2020-08-30 07:46:10 EDT <mephisto_74> Thank you for letting me know. Can't reach anyone at the Call Center to get a reference. But looks like a massive outage so hope they can resolve it soon
1300036330986979328 2020-08-30 07:43:09 EDT <GamerOsrs> Thanks for the link. American internet companies won't bother to issue specific statements like this in my experience, at least not quickly. Mine has outage maps but tells me "Everything looks good!" so I'll be left wondering over here
1300034687075840000 2020-08-30 07:36:37 EDT <mattydcb> >seems  You can't say it seems unless you have at least some kind of evidence pointing that way. I very much doubt a group is DDoS'ing multiple high profile companies all at the same time, that's why I wanted the source. Sounds much more like an outage with a host somewhere.
1300033844205121536 2020-08-30 07:33:16 EDT <Wyattgr15> Exactly. I understand that outages happen. But at this point, they should put out a statement of some kind. Their website isn‚Äôt even accessible to check the status yet and while on my mobile data, the outage is bleeding into other apps/websites

1300003429260165121 2020-08-30 05:32:25 EDT <JamRam96> Yeah its pretty rough. In order to get off of it, and pay for electricity AFTER you use it and not get any outages, you need to pass a "credit check" where they check your spending behaviour. And you can't do a big payment all at once, you can only top up 50 pounds at a time.
1299972026480951296 2020-08-30 03:27:38 EDT <VicDiGital> I'm more annoyed at the outage, because I KNOW everyone's second thought after initial shock was about Black Panther. I DON'T find this offensive because of how important this character is in the wider culture, in the REAL world. Boseman IS Black Panther.  They mattered, together
1299940512879849473 2020-08-30 01:22:24 EDT <Devina_Phoenix> Yes but I don't have someone to miss. So right now it's hard to sleep at night because I'm not tired and there is an internet outage till 2 am and I'm like on my phone going nuts.
1299939609158340608 2020-08-30 01:18:49 EDT <jawaidovich> @KElectricPk can take it's understanding and regrets and shove them where the sun doesn't shine.  Just tell me y my neighbors power was restored over 31 hours ago yet I am still waiting after 72 hours?  Also how long was the outage at Mr Alvi's home? If he had power issues?
1299926069504626689 2020-08-30 00:25:01 EDT <mirgray> I'm not saying it isn't required. I am questioning the PR problem of service outage at that particular moment.
1299903677654855680 2020-08-29 22:56:02 EDT <arshots> Well there was a cell phone outage for AT&T and I couldn‚Äôt update anything from today‚Äôs game till now!

1299876684259352579 2020-08-29 21:08:46 EDT <DimitriBianco> @ATT should refund customers who have extended outages. 18 hours so far with no internet. #CustomerService
1299866601282510852 2020-08-29 20:28:42 EDT <Menagerieof22> Why isn't it showing up on the outage map? Will you be posting updates even though you usually close at 9?
1299863043527016449 2020-08-29 20:14:34 EDT <jaybrownfrompet> Nope don‚Äôt know where you‚Äôre at, where I am Bell is not down and from talking to my peeps with bell a 12 hour outage sounds crazy. If that makes sense

1299857356994613248 2020-08-29 19:51:58 EDT <KennyTexas> Thank you sir. We don‚Äôt get hurricanes here on the Rolling Plains. 2 hours is the longest power outage in the 6 years we‚Äôve been here. But 2 hours is a long time to be without a/c at 118 degrees. And, I imagine it would add as much to the value of the house as it costs, no?

Concerned he drove up the road to the local country store and called AT&T's service line.  I believe it went something like this‚Ä¶
1299840444990402560 2020-08-29 18:44:46 EDT <eriklentz> I‚Äôm guessing this is what is causing the AT&T internet outage also?

It's 6:30 now and the app says things won't be fixed until 9:15. Do you know how time works?
1299828085588664320 2020-08-29 17:55:39 EDT <cityutilities> We appreciate your patience! We don‚Äôt have a good restoration estimate at this time due to the extent of the outages but know that crews are doing everything they can to get power restored as soon as possible.

1299796667655426059 2020-08-29 15:50:49 EDT <ReneAltena> I have had Kobos for many years and this is the first time I experience an outage like that... but the worst thing is that they don't communicate about it. Better would be to say: "our servers are down, it could be at least a day. Don't reset your devices, it isn't you!"
1299793428209897473 2020-08-29 15:37:56 EDT <startca> Hello btheadshots, this has been recognized as an outage as per 9:30am this morning and technicians have been alerted, but at this time we don't have an estimated time of repair.
1299790894313467904 2020-08-29 15:27:52 EDT <RvLeshrac> Service credits also need to be automatically applied, we shouldn't have to call in and scream at an underpaid CSR to get credit for days of outages.
1299781023740448768 2020-08-29 14:48:39 EDT <theuppercaset> I sent a dm yesterday but received no reply. There is a still widespread outage in our county. The last estimated time to repair was last night at 8pm. Now there isn't even a time to repair update.

1299755017155547138 2020-08-29 13:05:19 EDT <ImagedByDesign> @ATT Are you're customer service agents refusing to help your customers? Over 27 internet service outages, for two or three minutes at a time, in the last week. You sent me a modem, it didn't help for long. Is your internet that bad, or are your modems junk? 15 yr customer here.
1299752538162503681 2020-08-29 12:55:27 EDT <dr_pete> Locally, judging by Nextdoor, Comcast has faster speeds but more outages than AT&T.
1299752016864931840 2020-08-29 12:53:23 EDT <mythopoetica> I was really too under the weather earlier, heatwave + fatigue + power outage+ perimenopausal PMS is not a happy combination. Saturday has not been productive at all. And I think it can't be helped.

1299676182775037955 2020-08-29 07:52:03 EDT <CheeterPipe> I'm call Thursday morning at 2:15 am when I'm heard the transformer blow.  Our neighborhood has power but our 5 homes.  Why can't we have power too.  Not one Swepco truck has been down our little secrion of street and we've been taken off the outage map.  Why?

1299635621925916672 2020-08-29 05:10:52 EDT <kenneth_wilke> But the last 2 times that happened, the tech showed up to address a complete internet outage, which is frustrating. At least now the person who responded via Twitter was honest enough to say they can't promise a senior tech

Pls restore it at the earliest
1299600934146895872 2020-08-29 02:53:02 EDT <muasya_fred> This is quite devastating... It's been over two weeks now being in periodical black out. At Sunton, Power outage in a particular parten and no one @kplc cares. Business at stand still, communication dwarfed etc.... Why?????? Or don't we pay enough tax???
1299593603124047872 2020-08-29 02:23:54 EDT <JordanElChingon> At least with this power outage, I can just pretend she just didn't see my message and not ignored it lol
1299583809017520128 2020-08-29 01:44:59 EDT <joemcken> Well that blows. LIKE YOUR ELECTR‚Äî no sorry that was bad  Srsly tho, I hope you didn‚Äôt lose anything too expensive or irreplaceable. And at least it‚Äôs less than a week to wait, and then no more annoying outages. So there‚Äôs that.
1299570863944208390 2020-08-29 00:53:33 EDT <SherryT17> It doesn't work that way down here but ok. It is just wrong this happens so often at my house. I have been documenting how many times and how long outages last for a couple yrs now. We pay our bill on time. Weve lost so much food and its shameful. They should have us tied into
1299554647208857601 2020-08-28 23:49:07 EDT <Etung_princess> @aedcelectricity power outage at 4:46am, I don‚Äôt think this is fair at all.

1299547326068002816 2020-08-28 23:20:01 EDT <JodeanTownsend> üòÇ People do this at every power outage. They do this when there isn't a power outage and they've decided to run a generator in a workshop or basement. People don't pay attention to instructions. Natural disasters have nothing to do with it.

1299453842183131136 2020-08-28 17:08:33 EDT <jennaemoran> When you‚Äôre under tornado watch and the news says the sirens aren‚Äôt working due to a power outage I begin to get concerned. Oh btw, water, snacks, sanitizer, masks and social distancing in effect at shelters. WTF.
1299452336981639169 2020-08-28 17:02:34 EDT <JimLind13> Is THIS what should be bringing our outage? These are politicians, not pastors. He's pushing the American agenda & didn't follow with "...author and perfector of our faith." Is this REALLY worthy of our RAGE? Perhaps we direct Godly rage at one of the myriad of worthy offenses.

1299436827414269952 2020-08-28 16:00:56 EDT <Blondoid> Crap. My parents just lost power. I‚Äôm wondering if we should just go out now and buy ice in case we lose power as well. PSEG is really dropping the ball here. There isn‚Äôt even any weather going on at the moment and yet, there are outages all over the island.

1299403354045648897 2020-08-28 13:47:56 EDT <SvenskaFlicka29> Your website to track outages is inaccurate. Last night and this morning it showed the outage at my address as impacting 2900+ customers. Now it‚Äôs showing no reported outage and I still don‚Äôt power. So 2900+ customers are still without power but you‚Äôre showing that as resolved.
1299397590765776899 2020-08-28 13:25:01 EDT <CrypticHze> So yesterday there was a power outage followed by a tornado in my area so I wasn't able to stream yesterday.  I will start streaming today at 2pm EST to make up time.  See you there :)

1299346800244121601 2020-08-28 10:03:12 EDT <Southside_Tech> Transformers, we had a short internet outage at school starting at about 9:30a! Systems should be back up and running now.

1299335092930830337 2020-08-28 09:16:41 EDT <sameer9200> @KElectricPk Yesterday we were getting uninterrupted power supply in heavy rain. At night you turned off the power supply as precaution, 'checked' the area, 'fixed the faults' and we have had hours of power outage ever since. If it ain't broke, don't touch it!
1299327609256452102 2020-08-28 08:46:57 EDT <cenewman0> Ugh no, I haven't heard anything from Entergy and their outage map still doesn't show an estimate. I'm at the Ford dealership now getting a tire fixed/replaced and then tbh I'm most likely heading to AL. I'm not doing f2f lab next Mon anyway.
1299327070770802690 2020-08-28 08:44:48 EDT <GrillingG33k> No it's not cause I reported an outage at my house SEVERAL times, and each time I asked your automated system for an update, it said an outage hadn't been reported at my address.
1299324251519037440 2020-08-28 08:33:36 EDT <Iakkav> I've been laughing at the  city's social media posts, I love reading these! Didn't see a lot of variety before because they were all complaining about the water and power outages lmao City is still in debt but I think that's just because I suck at this lol
1299319569920729091 2020-08-28 08:15:00 EDT <hijakamran> No suspension of mobile networks on orders of the Sindh government today. Most of the outage is because of the rain yesterday, apparently. But even the planned restriction on Ashura doesn't make sense, especially when we have to deal with a disaster, at least for this week.
1299319503323566080 2020-08-28 08:14:44 EDT <kylewillett> @ATT fiber outage at my house. Waited a couple days for my service apt yesterday with a 4hr window. No one shows up. They reschedule me 5 days in the future. Rep tells me this is procedure, not enough techs, must get back in line. No guarantee this won‚Äôt happen again on that day.
1299316976393875457 2020-08-28 08:04:41 EDT <xtinabirknstock> @DuquesneLight would be great if you'd even list our outage on your map. I haven't seen it on there since the power went out last night at 7.
1299314220899741703 2020-08-28 07:53:45 EDT <MrDarcy1815> Well he's 8, so I'm not sure if say well adjusted is the right word. Unless a fascination with burping and breaking wind counts as normal for you.  I can't remember a powercut since the 80s. Suspect no different than internet outages at the office.  1/2
1299314151878209542 2020-08-28 07:53:28 EDT <CuratedbyPamela> I really don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs an accurate way to position this. It‚Äôs not helping him to win at all. It‚Äôs showing that the outage is strong and that sends a clearer message about the level of engagement. In my opinion.
1299314102033100809 2020-08-28 07:53:16 EDT <OpenreachHelp> Hi Fiona, I can't find any outages at Kyre exchange. If the fault has been reported then the provider should be able to offer an update to your parents in-law. I really do hope it can be resolve quickly for them. ^Antony
1299311239617826821 2020-08-28 07:41:54 EDT <JayHadHope> This also ignores that no network has 100% uptime though, especially not home Internet which wasn't intended for full usage all day.  And if an outage or your line gets cut? At least 24 hours downtime.
1299303873300004865 2020-08-28 07:12:37 EDT <yh_crockett> I want to know why @Entergy can't seem to get the power on in Colmesneil, TX. Calling the outage help line gets me nowhere. They just give out bogus estimated information. At 3:00 yesterday they said power would be on by 10p. At 9p they said by 10p the next day. #ENTERGY #outage

1299180688273481731 2020-08-27 23:03:08 EDT <HardTriggerJ> @Xfinity I pay over $200 and wife and I work remotely now but get internet outage EVERY DAY for the past month. Affecting work/business. No way to contact an agent for compensation of hours lost. AT&T may get a call from me soon
1299173555184304128 2020-08-27 22:34:47 EDT <cowboycane> The ‚Äúpower outage‚Äù at Camden Yards to keep Ripken‚Äôs streak going. Because he said he wouldn‚Äôt play that night. Because he found out his wife had hooked up with Costner. ALLEGEDLY.
1299171072974098433 2020-08-27 22:24:55 EDT <kelscohen> @Cascadelink hey there, we haven‚Äôt had internet since 10 this morning. Do you know why? We live at Alley24 apartments and the customer service guy doesn‚Äôt know why we‚Äôre experiencing an outage

1299153776318861317 2020-08-27 21:16:12 EDT <NateLord53> Is @ATT having some sort of outage? TV just went out and restart has not helped. Tried restarting the TV box and router with no luck. What‚Äôs up??
1299147511194480640 2020-08-27 20:51:18 EDT <naty_melt> ....I don‚Äôt need a map on the outages. I‚Äôve been sitting at home for the past 6 hours without power. At this point it‚Äôs hotter in the house than it is outside.  https://twitter.com/entergy/status/1299089339834658822¬†‚Ä¶
1299145817966559232 2020-08-27 20:44:34 EDT <benjivoices> So if things weren't bad enough already here in Melbourne, the storm last night caused a power outage at the main water filtering facility.

1299131703655649280 2020-08-27 19:48:29 EDT <Vindicat0r1> I mean, it is their fault, cause they gave no warnings and apparently don't know when they're turning it back on, despite them saying it was going to be back on at 1:30pm. It literally took me and my parents ~45 mins to even get the announcement that there was a widespread outage

1299112657169969152 2020-08-27 18:32:48 EDT <BeccaWhitnall> Anyone else experiencing power outage in T.O.? (I thought it was just me because we are having some work done at home involving electrical things and figured something had gone wrong until my neighbors volunteered theirs was out.)
1299112075432808448 2020-08-27 18:30:29 EDT <ATT> Hi Patti, we just wanted to check in. Are you still experiencing an outage?

1299108727266725890 2020-08-27 18:17:11 EDT <tiogamom1> Power outage. Can't even cook inside. Going out. Won't be able to watch RNC tonight at this rate.
1299105307843604480 2020-08-27 18:03:36 EDT <SpielbWhalley> Looking at the outage map, and taking screen shots to compare who gets restored first. Noticed Seymour not mentioned with 911 out. The 443 customers that can‚Äôt use generators lost power for about 2 minutes well after the worst passed. Let‚Äôs see if it remains up through the night.
1299104158432231430 2020-08-27 17:59:02 EDT <Melohello> Dear @Xfinity, fix it geezus. The internet outage happened at the most critical part of the meeting. Is @ATT wireless having issues too? My phone is saying slow wireless connection.
1299102762047803397 2020-08-27 17:53:29 EDT <NachoManeNeek> Now I see why Comcast is bad. AT&T internet might be slow and garbage but I never had an outage.
1299095591801286656 2020-08-27 17:24:59 EDT <CBallengerMusic> Over 4 hours without power here! Doesn‚Äôt seem like it‚Äôs really a rolling or periodic outage at this point.

1299089334411329536 2020-08-27 17:00:07 EDT <NiteStar> I feel really bad for them if @EversourceCT  is their utility provider. At least UI is a little better. Not sure anyone beats @ConEdison for storm response. Am kinda new to CT. Didn't know utility providers did NOT give customers reimbursement for food after power outages! üò±üò±
1299088065621680128 2020-08-27 16:55:05 EDT <jacksonhvisuals> Wouldn‚Äôt it be nice if internet service providers reduced your bill by $5 every time a multi-hour outage occured?  F*cking Cox internet has gone down for its monthly outage of at least 3 hours.   This is ridiculous. I have class. I have work.
1299082332649992192 2020-08-27 16:32:18 EDT <PatrioticMrs> Dose anyone have AT&T Uverse? If so, are you having an outage?

1299077544474370048 2020-08-27 16:13:16 EDT <Tom32805327> Solar panels never degrade. They're worse than plastic in landfills and what it takes to make them. And without subsidies they Aren't affordable for most. We have no better efficient energy than oil. Look at the power outages in California. That's "green" energy on display.
1299075175967850497 2020-08-27 16:03:52 EDT <aKeaneMachine> me: man that power outage at the beginning of august was terrible I hope that doesn‚Äôt happen again  nature: haha guess what
1299073777897074688 2020-08-27 15:58:18 EDT <Teirersias> Update:  @Bell hasn't replied to my email or followed up on the open ticket number we have. When the outage first occurred I was at 9GB of usage, it slowly trickled to 11GB. The signal was so weak the Turbo Hub modem couldn't even run a home wifi network.   @CRTCeng
1299071474683310080 2020-08-27 15:49:09 EDT <OGShortyySlim> Cause these outages ain‚Äôt it, boss. Never had this problem with AT&T Uverse ü§î
1299060530305359872 2020-08-27 15:05:40 EDT <seanprzano> I switched to Spectrum because I had to. AT&T didn‚Äôt offer anything fast enough for heavy media upload/downloads for work. When I lived super close to you my internet sucked. Now that I‚Äôm farther from the mountains it‚Äôs not too bad. Still sucks though. Just less outages it seems.

1299026378256351232 2020-08-27 12:49:57 EDT <lucy_haggard> A new school year started online at @SVVSD just over a week ago.

1299010112716255232 2020-08-27 11:45:19 EDT <sammyharlan> I do apologize that my current commissions didn't roll out as quickly as hoped. Between losing most of the week at the beginning of August from a multi-day power outage and my anxiety continuing to get worse it's been real hard getting things done :/
1299008078990499845 2020-08-27 11:37:15 EDT <bradybrewer> So far in this first week of class: Zoom went down, authentication services went down, media platform hosting online videos in LMS went down, and now a campus wide internet outage. Don't know if I should be mad at IT, or go buy them a beer because of the week they've had.
1299006111723532293 2020-08-27 11:29:26 EDT <bruceclarkprof> Yeah, hate this. Especially dangerous online, when an internet outage can take down your exam. At the same time, I find some students won't read material unless there is a test. I have to hope the studying is the learning. . .
1298998454790656000 2020-08-27 10:59:00 EDT <3GavinsMake1> So uhh  Hurricane Laura's up...and it maaay be coming my way  I know that I don't get on here as often as I should, but like, if I'm not on by then, it might be a power outage, at best, or maybe just strong winds.

Second call your staff so no reports of this outage, meaning my 1st call wasn't sent to proper location. This is the second time in 2 days...
1298969871460397058 2020-08-27 09:05:25 EDT <Spawn_CO> I've done that, several times. It does nothing. I can't speak to a customer service rep and at this point your $10 credits aren't enough. You've cost me over $2500 in lost wages due to the outages. This is unacceptable. You can have some high level form of management call me.

1298834242978435072 2020-08-27 00:06:29 EDT <Uncle_Ruff> I haven't eaten dinner at all. In fact, I skipped TWO meals. I last ate at maybe 230pm. Was scheduled to eat next between 5-6pm, but all this shit popped off and there were power outages on my block so I just went out for a bike & run, came back and now here we are. I üíú it.

The edge hasn't spared us wind, rain, and long power outages the last couple times around. I'm not breathing any sighs of relief until at least tomorrow afternoon.

1298768061105876995 2020-08-26 19:43:30 EDT <thehillwitch> @MediacomSupport today was the first day we talked to an agent who didn't chalk our #outage up to the #derecho and actually looked at our modem. So shout out to Dixie for being the only capable employee you apparently have.
1298759723999727617 2020-08-26 19:10:22 EDT <BluebonnetCoop> Speaking for Bluebonnet, we will not take any intentional outages due to the impending hurricane.

1298754397242101760 2020-08-26 18:49:12 EDT <Lilena91> :DD I WOULD LOVE THAT! ...perhaps sometime after Hurricane Laura passes. I don't think I'll be affected all that much, but the most that I expect to happen are power outages. Where I'm at is barely out of the danger zone anyhow...
1298751553822773248 2020-08-26 18:37:54 EDT <angry_ohio> Do they have a plan to enforce non-compliance? This is the outage I'm seeing at my son's college. I've started to pop off & don't know if I shld try to take it up w/ college or elsewhere. Plans are meaningless if you don't enforce. We've shown that we are all not good Samaritans.

1298538540758777859 2020-08-26 04:31:28 EDT <Mal_hans2> I checked the outage reports on AT&T and T-Mobile as well. They're all having problems in what seems major cities  i.e. Denver, Los Angeles, Seattle, NYC, DC, Boston...  I'm calling it now that something VERY sketchy seems to be going on. Can't simply be coincidence...
1298532632188329984 2020-08-26 04:07:59 EDT <KeyllDarree> Thankfully the internet outages across the island haven't caught us at KD. If you're struggling at home remember we have the IT room and wifi throughout the building!
1298500433846116352 2020-08-26 02:00:03 EDT <VodafoneUK> Hey Matthew üëã We don't want you feeling this was as a customer and if there is an outage/issue with your Broadband then we certainly look into this for you. Can you please drop us a DM with your full name & account number/landline so we can take a closer look at this? Danny  https://twitter.com/messages/compose?recipient_id=20678384¬†‚Ä¶
1298500156669808640 2020-08-26 01:58:56 EDT <richabowyer> Feel better now? Don't believe I did defend the abuser? You let your moral outage at the abuse cloud your ability to talk about it.
1298494441339068416 2020-08-26 01:36:14 EDT <Ugbaddd> I don‚Äôt know if there‚Äôs an outage but I don‚Äôt have service at all. I can‚Äôt call and I don‚Äôt have internet.  #TMobile
1298485097188995074 2020-08-26 00:59:06 EDT <_Danka_tv> @Ask_Spectrum these random midnight outages are pushing me more and more towards @ATT
1298467203440947200 2020-08-25 23:48:00 EDT <chocoemo> Basic stuff ready at home in case of power outage. Canned foods I can eat from, plenty of water, and a couple Power banks to keep my phone charged up. If anyone thinks of anything else I should have that I didn‚Äôt list, please let me know here and I‚Äôll grab it while leaving work.
1298464924327383040 2020-08-25 23:38:56 EDT <Kelendal> AT&T is fucking us over in rural west KY. Daily outages stretching for most of the day.
1298462674896867328 2020-08-25 23:30:00 EDT <ch_reese> @pldt @PLDT_Cares @iamMVP should at the very least give us the reason why there was an outage or interruption in the area and not just say that there's a link loss because it is important that people other than their subscribers know why they can't go online for class or work.
1298457139841601538 2020-08-25 23:08:00 EDT <rpointdujourpt> So what happens when I have MAD things to do online and AT&T has a service outage?  Two online tDPT courses. One huge continuing education course. Three mini continuing education courses. A self review of performance for work. I'm going to go out of my mind.
1298452975187353600 2020-08-25 22:51:28 EDT <angelicatx_> PSA ON POWER OUTAGES! As someone how works at an energy company, please DO NOT get mad for the long hold times and if we can‚Äôt give an estimated time of restoration of power. This is expected. Your provider has NO control when it comes to power outages.
1298449889773473797 2020-08-25 22:39:12 EDT <Buchmn> @Ask_Spectrum can you tell me if I'm currently in an outage? The outage site isn't working for me at the moment.
1298433379625586688 2020-08-25 21:33:36 EDT <KatzStats> My son starts his senior year of college tomorrow. It's all distance learning for now. But thanks to the asshats at #PSEG we have no power in #Teaneck #NewJersey. You can't #WorkFromHome with no electricity. Second long outage in a few weeks. @PSEGdelivers @PSEGNews @northjersey
1298432939391422464 2020-08-25 21:31:51 EDT <frodofilms> hi sorry i haven't been active today at all my whole county had a wifi outage ‚ù§Ô∏è
1298432420438368256 2020-08-25 21:29:47 EDT <rpointdujourpt> @ATTHelp Can you help?  I have a red light next to Alarm on my AT&T box. Is there an outage?  I have work to do.
1298427392067739649 2020-08-25 21:09:48 EDT <rpointdujourpt> AT&T has an internet outage right now in LA
1298423183213699072 2020-08-25 20:53:05 EDT <AmyMAcosta78> @CoxComm @CoxHelp @CoxComm What is going on with the Avondale, AZ outage - no notice, no updates, no assistance. Service is desperately needed for work at home and online schooling - where's the transparency?!? It's pretty sad that I have to use an @ATT hotspot...what gives?!?
1298416693891330049 2020-08-25 20:27:17 EDT <_jazzyboo26> Is anyone else having an outage with @ATT üòí
1298405661768847361 2020-08-25 19:43:27 EDT <cinnabaron> Small life update! In the path of Hurricane Laura currently, I doubt it‚Äôll be major other than some rain and maybe some wind. At worst a power outage; so don‚Äôt worry. But if I do disappear that‚Äôs why!
1298404627386445825 2020-08-25 19:39:21 EDT <Freckled_Smudge> @OANN Are you having an outage?  It cuts out during commercial and now its totally down. What is going on over there.  I wanted to see the RNC convention tonight.  Now I have to go over to RSB to view it.  Come on!!!!  ROKU LIVE STREAM IS TOTALLY DOWN! WON'T LOAD AT ALL!
1298403196960944133 2020-08-25 19:33:39 EDT <sjalexander> don't think so. no reason to expect we'd need to; it's really only indicated if you're likely to flood (we're not) or if it's likely to blow your house down (it's not).  The risks are mainly crap blowing thru the air at speed into/through your windows, and extended power outage
1298401255916625920 2020-08-25 19:25:57 EDT <CloudyDay28> @ATT I want my internet back. üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠ Damn outage.
1298401249621147649 2020-08-25 19:25:55 EDT <nspowerinc> Sorry for the confusion, Matt. Regarding the emergency outage in Dartmouth, we called all impacted customers today. If you didn't receive a call, please send us a DM with your contact info so we can update it in our system. The outage started at approx. 8pm & should last 30 mins.
1298398574842003456 2020-08-25 19:15:17 EDT <KingxCmart> Wow, came home from work n there is no power...üò©  Looked at PG&E site n said they don‚Äôt have an ETA when the power will be back on. They are ‚Äúinvestigating‚Äù the cause of the outage....üòí  And today started off really good....
1298379446362267651 2020-08-25 17:59:17 EDT <tjrobotham> lmao a screed against technology dependence from an outage I didn't know was happening at the time because the people affected *weren't dependent enough on that particular tool to make a lot of noise about it*  https://twitter.com/CBCNews/status/1298334468130975745¬†‚Ä¶
1298378287870353408 2020-08-25 17:54:41 EDT <jamesbkennedy> Continued weirdness re: @EntergyMS. I had issues with outage reporter & emails Thursday. Today, a voicemail from an AR number & asking me to call @Entergy at a specific extension that doesn‚Äôt exist.  Customer rep transfers me to a voicemail with no greeting message. Puzzling.
