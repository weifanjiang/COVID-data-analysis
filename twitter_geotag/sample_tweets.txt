1300497670096650246 2020-08-31 14:16:21 EDT <iam_gujju> They had different scenario. It wasn't global outage at all. They should have continued ‚úåÔ∏è but still respect for Armenia.. Such a strong team with Levon üî•
1300491720304390144 2020-08-31 13:52:42 EDT <TSS_Raj> (6) But don't be the sucker who buys on the split simply because the price dropped. Be smart, trade with a reputable broker who doesn't have outages and who will get you the stock at the price you see. Most brokerages don't have commission trade fees anymore either.
1300491305697644545 2020-08-31 13:51:03 EDT <nayeliiidiazzz> LOL professors are something else I had a professor who said to look at the weather forecast beforehand to avoid a power outage.

1300484811824349184 2020-08-31 13:25:15 EDT <MrPoopGaming> So just got off the phone with XFinity, apparently there's a massive internet service outage where I live... probably won't get fixed till this afternoon at the earliest. :/ We'll try again tomorrow! Really sorry guys, I feel awful...
1300479827179384832 2020-08-31 13:05:27 EDT <TestedSokr> I know! Also power outages aren‚Äôt uncommon here. They happen at least once a week here. I was really worried
1300473355582214144 2020-08-31 12:39:44 EDT <AnthonyPoirier1> @ATT any chance someone can tell me an ETR on the outage in my area? Getting tired of listening to my flat mates complaint about it for the past three hours.
1300471324175933442 2020-08-31 12:31:39 EDT <dkovacs2012> Because anybody can play online people want to have fun. You can't ever predict that something like this will happen a storm can happen and a power outage can happen at random moment internet companies can fuck you over any second

1300460680978587648 2020-08-31 11:49:22 EDT <PiPrimePi> I was pointing out the irony in the outage of 17 year old in our streets, but we are willing to send 18 year olds to foreign countries, to fight in those streets.    He was attacked. And acted in self defense from everything I have seen. He shouldn‚Äôt have been there at all.

1300458276098801665 2020-08-31 11:39:49 EDT <DwgpndSurf> I have Verizon and haven't had any issues. I'm also in Florida.  But we did receive an email at work that mentioned widespread outage issues impacting a lot of different types of services.  Don't know if it's a result of the hurricane blowing up through the states or what.
1300454006574198789 2020-08-31 11:22:51 EDT <kcmetrobus> We will ask them to look into this. Is it always the same RapidRide line, or different ones? We'd like to narrow it down so we can alert the vehicle maintenance team at that base. We don't have a report of wide-spread outages, so we like to be able to look at specific coaches.
1300445892168671233 2020-08-31 10:50:36 EDT <Midcontinent> Good morning! I know how important the internet is and I can definitely help. I don't see any outages nearby that should be causing trouble.

A map would be handy since your website says not to call & ask, & when I do call & ask they say "maybe" & "we don't have a status at this time". Is there ANY information at all for 27107 & whether there's an outage? Don't say sorry.

Being without power for 19 hours is maddening. Fingers crossed at this point that all our refrigerated/frozen food stuffs made it. Didn‚Äôt open anything.

1300243030176223232 2020-08-30 21:24:30 EDT <Martian_High> True. At least, so long as the majority of Americans can stay inside, have access to food and creature comforts, and aren't yet broke and on the edge of eviction.  But you know what doesn't go out in a power outage? Cell service. And at this point, it probably shouldn't go out.

1300124083984580609 2020-08-30 13:31:51 EDT <KICHUVINOD> I'll tell you what I meant by my tweet..Levon CLAIMED PUBLICLY that they proved the issue wasn't at their end..If the issue wasnt at their end, they shouldv been given a rematch. Global outage is just a cause for the DC to occur. It could be some server error somewhere local(1/2)
1300122163429609472 2020-08-30 13:24:13 EDT <KICHUVINOD> I don't care if there was a global outage..If the issue wasn't at Armenia's end, how would a global outage or a local outage for that matter make a difference?

They explicitly say it's part of their SLA (service level agreement) which means that if you pay for it, you get reimbursed for any slight outage (at the enterprise level, it's 25x reimbursement which is silly). And the reimbursement is automatic unlike others.
1300101238588088328 2020-08-30 12:01:04 EDT <davepdotorg> At least I know Pushover isn't affected by this outage...

1300088311722250242 2020-08-30 11:09:42 EDT <aptasi> A large scale internet outage started ~four hours ago, affecting many websites and service providers including Comcast, CenturyLink, AT&T, Level 3, Time Warner Telecom, Cogent, UUNet Verizon, Cox, Cloudflare, Google, Microsoft, and many more.    https://www.thousandeyes.com/outages¬†

1300081661925888001 2020-08-30 10:43:17 EDT <DadTheDM2> Woke up, it's my #birthday, still no internet. Made some coffee and forgot the creamer went bad in the outage. Walked 30 mins to the store to get creamer (fiance's at work with my truck) and they don't have any. Get a #javamonster instead. Trip on my way home and drop it opened.

1300073866904178692 2020-08-30 10:12:18 EDT <riskiing> I have no idea what I'm going to do when I get back. I'm running out of money to stay in Austin, and fast. I can't go back to my apartment or my parent's house, both are damaged plus this utility outage is  expected to last at least 6 weeks. I dont know what to do
1300072374147190786 2020-08-30 10:06:22 EDT <zzhenqtinq> Luckily I didn't have an outage at all though. For my fanmeet it was just the service and I lost an hour of it. But my internet was perfectly fine. For me it was the company of the group's fault. I'm sorry to hear this though :c having an outage sucks :c
1300067935453667333 2020-08-30 09:48:44 EDT <billythenerd3> What are you paying a month for AT&T Fiber? I‚Äôve been with Spectrum for a long time but recent outages are getting old. I‚Äôm considering switching.
1300067204512321536 2020-08-30 09:45:50 EDT <zzhenqtinq> Ahh so there was a kpop fanmeet going on and their server crashed for a lot of people worldwide, and some ignorant people were spreading lies saying "it's a personal issue and spectrum had outage on the east coast" when that wasn't true at all :c

1300059803625164815 2020-08-30 09:16:25 EDT <alannerd614> One would think, with all the money @Delta makes (at least prior to covid), an "internet outage" wouldn't prevent a plane from taking off.   Maybe have secondary connections, etc...
1300059775472992256 2020-08-30 09:16:19 EDT <DakotaJames6> Global outage for the internet, appears to be a problem with @centurylink . On a Sunday when absolutely no one is at their call centers to answer questions and apparently they can‚Äôt be bothered to use social media to explain or inform Us as to why.
1300056850621239298 2020-08-30 09:04:41 EDT <DeboostedLucy4> AT&T was down in my area for over 24 hours.  Error message was something about security. On their website, it said an outage affected 0-151 people.  When I called them, they said a line had been cut.
1300056270297161728 2020-08-30 09:02:23 EDT <Tellisaurus_Dex> We're now in hr number 3 of the net outage at my job. Haven't taken a call since about 3:15, it's now 6am.
1300050251332694016 2020-08-30 08:38:28 EDT <ToffeeSwirl> Twitch seems to be having issues this morning.  There are outages all over.  Haven't been able to watch any streams for at least an hour this morning.
1300048785293352960 2020-08-30 08:32:38 EDT <BigBroeyJoey> Isn't this the second time in a pretty short time that there is a big outage at cloudflare? Such a treat having so many sites using the same service üëå
1300039060023513091 2020-08-30 07:54:00 EDT <CCG_LV> @steveschorr Cox employees are saying they are doing the outage in purpose for customers to upgrade their service. They had me replace my modem to a panoramic last week, guess what? I don‚Äôt have Internet at all. This is a class action lawsuit waiting to happen.
1300037088621015040 2020-08-30 07:46:10 EDT <mephisto_74> Thank you for letting me know. Can't reach anyone at the Call Center to get a reference. But looks like a massive outage so hope they can resolve it soon
1300036330986979328 2020-08-30 07:43:09 EDT <GamerOsrs> Thanks for the link. American internet companies won't bother to issue specific statements like this in my experience, at least not quickly. Mine has outage maps but tells me "Everything looks good!" so I'll be left wondering over here
1300034687075840000 2020-08-30 07:36:37 EDT <mattydcb> >seems  You can't say it seems unless you have at least some kind of evidence pointing that way. I very much doubt a group is DDoS'ing multiple high profile companies all at the same time, that's why I wanted the source. Sounds much more like an outage with a host somewhere.
1300033844205121536 2020-08-30 07:33:16 EDT <Wyattgr15> Exactly. I understand that outages happen. But at this point, they should put out a statement of some kind. Their website isn‚Äôt even accessible to check the status yet and while on my mobile data, the outage is bleeding into other apps/websites

1300003429260165121 2020-08-30 05:32:25 EDT <JamRam96> Yeah its pretty rough. In order to get off of it, and pay for electricity AFTER you use it and not get any outages, you need to pass a "credit check" where they check your spending behaviour. And you can't do a big payment all at once, you can only top up 50 pounds at a time.
1299972026480951296 2020-08-30 03:27:38 EDT <VicDiGital> I'm more annoyed at the outage, because I KNOW everyone's second thought after initial shock was about Black Panther. I DON'T find this offensive because of how important this character is in the wider culture, in the REAL world. Boseman IS Black Panther.  They mattered, together
1299940512879849473 2020-08-30 01:22:24 EDT <Devina_Phoenix> Yes but I don't have someone to miss. So right now it's hard to sleep at night because I'm not tired and there is an internet outage till 2 am and I'm like on my phone going nuts.
1299939609158340608 2020-08-30 01:18:49 EDT <jawaidovich> @KElectricPk can take it's understanding and regrets and shove them where the sun doesn't shine.  Just tell me y my neighbors power was restored over 31 hours ago yet I am still waiting after 72 hours?  Also how long was the outage at Mr Alvi's home? If he had power issues?
1299926069504626689 2020-08-30 00:25:01 EDT <mirgray> I'm not saying it isn't required. I am questioning the PR problem of service outage at that particular moment.
1299903677654855680 2020-08-29 22:56:02 EDT <arshots> Well there was a cell phone outage for AT&T and I couldn‚Äôt update anything from today‚Äôs game till now!

1299876684259352579 2020-08-29 21:08:46 EDT <DimitriBianco> @ATT should refund customers who have extended outages. 18 hours so far with no internet. #CustomerService
1299866601282510852 2020-08-29 20:28:42 EDT <Menagerieof22> Why isn't it showing up on the outage map? Will you be posting updates even though you usually close at 9?
1299863043527016449 2020-08-29 20:14:34 EDT <jaybrownfrompet> Nope don‚Äôt know where you‚Äôre at, where I am Bell is not down and from talking to my peeps with bell a 12 hour outage sounds crazy. If that makes sense

1299857356994613248 2020-08-29 19:51:58 EDT <KennyTexas> Thank you sir. We don‚Äôt get hurricanes here on the Rolling Plains. 2 hours is the longest power outage in the 6 years we‚Äôve been here. But 2 hours is a long time to be without a/c at 118 degrees. And, I imagine it would add as much to the value of the house as it costs, no?

Concerned he drove up the road to the local country store and called AT&T's service line.  I believe it went something like this‚Ä¶
1299840444990402560 2020-08-29 18:44:46 EDT <eriklentz> I‚Äôm guessing this is what is causing the AT&T internet outage also?

It's 6:30 now and the app says things won't be fixed until 9:15. Do you know how time works?
1299828085588664320 2020-08-29 17:55:39 EDT <cityutilities> We appreciate your patience! We don‚Äôt have a good restoration estimate at this time due to the extent of the outages but know that crews are doing everything they can to get power restored as soon as possible.

1299796667655426059 2020-08-29 15:50:49 EDT <ReneAltena> I have had Kobos for many years and this is the first time I experience an outage like that... but the worst thing is that they don't communicate about it. Better would be to say: "our servers are down, it could be at least a day. Don't reset your devices, it isn't you!"
1299793428209897473 2020-08-29 15:37:56 EDT <startca> Hello btheadshots, this has been recognized as an outage as per 9:30am this morning and technicians have been alerted, but at this time we don't have an estimated time of repair.
1299790894313467904 2020-08-29 15:27:52 EDT <RvLeshrac> Service credits also need to be automatically applied, we shouldn't have to call in and scream at an underpaid CSR to get credit for days of outages.
1299781023740448768 2020-08-29 14:48:39 EDT <theuppercaset> I sent a dm yesterday but received no reply. There is a still widespread outage in our county. The last estimated time to repair was last night at 8pm. Now there isn't even a time to repair update.

1299755017155547138 2020-08-29 13:05:19 EDT <ImagedByDesign> @ATT Are you're customer service agents refusing to help your customers? Over 27 internet service outages, for two or three minutes at a time, in the last week. You sent me a modem, it didn't help for long. Is your internet that bad, or are your modems junk? 15 yr customer here.
1299752538162503681 2020-08-29 12:55:27 EDT <dr_pete> Locally, judging by Nextdoor, Comcast has faster speeds but more outages than AT&T.
1299752016864931840 2020-08-29 12:53:23 EDT <mythopoetica> I was really too under the weather earlier, heatwave + fatigue + power outage+ perimenopausal PMS is not a happy combination. Saturday has not been productive at all. And I think it can't be helped.

1299676182775037955 2020-08-29 07:52:03 EDT <CheeterPipe> I'm call Thursday morning at 2:15 am when I'm heard the transformer blow.  Our neighborhood has power but our 5 homes.  Why can't we have power too.  Not one Swepco truck has been down our little secrion of street and we've been taken off the outage map.  Why?

1299635621925916672 2020-08-29 05:10:52 EDT <kenneth_wilke> But the last 2 times that happened, the tech showed up to address a complete internet outage, which is frustrating. At least now the person who responded via Twitter was honest enough to say they can't promise a senior tech

Pls restore it at the earliest
1299600934146895872 2020-08-29 02:53:02 EDT <muasya_fred> This is quite devastating... It's been over two weeks now being in periodical black out. At Sunton, Power outage in a particular parten and no one @kplc cares. Business at stand still, communication dwarfed etc.... Why?????? Or don't we pay enough tax???
1299593603124047872 2020-08-29 02:23:54 EDT <JordanElChingon> At least with this power outage, I can just pretend she just didn't see my message and not ignored it lol
1299583809017520128 2020-08-29 01:44:59 EDT <joemcken> Well that blows. LIKE YOUR ELECTR‚Äî no sorry that was bad  Srsly tho, I hope you didn‚Äôt lose anything too expensive or irreplaceable. And at least it‚Äôs less than a week to wait, and then no more annoying outages. So there‚Äôs that.
1299570863944208390 2020-08-29 00:53:33 EDT <SherryT17> It doesn't work that way down here but ok. It is just wrong this happens so often at my house. I have been documenting how many times and how long outages last for a couple yrs now. We pay our bill on time. Weve lost so much food and its shameful. They should have us tied into
1299554647208857601 2020-08-28 23:49:07 EDT <Etung_princess> @aedcelectricity power outage at 4:46am, I don‚Äôt think this is fair at all.

1299547326068002816 2020-08-28 23:20:01 EDT <JodeanTownsend> üòÇ People do this at every power outage. They do this when there isn't a power outage and they've decided to run a generator in a workshop or basement. People don't pay attention to instructions. Natural disasters have nothing to do with it.

1299453842183131136 2020-08-28 17:08:33 EDT <jennaemoran> When you‚Äôre under tornado watch and the news says the sirens aren‚Äôt working due to a power outage I begin to get concerned. Oh btw, water, snacks, sanitizer, masks and social distancing in effect at shelters. WTF.
1299452336981639169 2020-08-28 17:02:34 EDT <JimLind13> Is THIS what should be bringing our outage? These are politicians, not pastors. He's pushing the American agenda & didn't follow with "...author and perfector of our faith." Is this REALLY worthy of our RAGE? Perhaps we direct Godly rage at one of the myriad of worthy offenses.

1299436827414269952 2020-08-28 16:00:56 EDT <Blondoid> Crap. My parents just lost power. I‚Äôm wondering if we should just go out now and buy ice in case we lose power as well. PSEG is really dropping the ball here. There isn‚Äôt even any weather going on at the moment and yet, there are outages all over the island.

1299403354045648897 2020-08-28 13:47:56 EDT <SvenskaFlicka29> Your website to track outages is inaccurate. Last night and this morning it showed the outage at my address as impacting 2900+ customers. Now it‚Äôs showing no reported outage and I still don‚Äôt power. So 2900+ customers are still without power but you‚Äôre showing that as resolved.
1299397590765776899 2020-08-28 13:25:01 EDT <CrypticHze> So yesterday there was a power outage followed by a tornado in my area so I wasn't able to stream yesterday.  I will start streaming today at 2pm EST to make up time.  See you there :)

1299346800244121601 2020-08-28 10:03:12 EDT <Southside_Tech> Transformers, we had a short internet outage at school starting at about 9:30a! Systems should be back up and running now.

1299335092930830337 2020-08-28 09:16:41 EDT <sameer9200> @KElectricPk Yesterday we were getting uninterrupted power supply in heavy rain. At night you turned off the power supply as precaution, 'checked' the area, 'fixed the faults' and we have had hours of power outage ever since. If it ain't broke, don't touch it!
1299327609256452102 2020-08-28 08:46:57 EDT <cenewman0> Ugh no, I haven't heard anything from Entergy and their outage map still doesn't show an estimate. I'm at the Ford dealership now getting a tire fixed/replaced and then tbh I'm most likely heading to AL. I'm not doing f2f lab next Mon anyway.
1299327070770802690 2020-08-28 08:44:48 EDT <GrillingG33k> No it's not cause I reported an outage at my house SEVERAL times, and each time I asked your automated system for an update, it said an outage hadn't been reported at my address.
1299324251519037440 2020-08-28 08:33:36 EDT <Iakkav> I've been laughing at the  city's social media posts, I love reading these! Didn't see a lot of variety before because they were all complaining about the water and power outages lmao City is still in debt but I think that's just because I suck at this lol
1299319569920729091 2020-08-28 08:15:00 EDT <hijakamran> No suspension of mobile networks on orders of the Sindh government today. Most of the outage is because of the rain yesterday, apparently. But even the planned restriction on Ashura doesn't make sense, especially when we have to deal with a disaster, at least for this week.
1299319503323566080 2020-08-28 08:14:44 EDT <kylewillett> @ATT fiber outage at my house. Waited a couple days for my service apt yesterday with a 4hr window. No one shows up. They reschedule me 5 days in the future. Rep tells me this is procedure, not enough techs, must get back in line. No guarantee this won‚Äôt happen again on that day.
1299316976393875457 2020-08-28 08:04:41 EDT <xtinabirknstock> @DuquesneLight would be great if you'd even list our outage on your map. I haven't seen it on there since the power went out last night at 7.
1299314220899741703 2020-08-28 07:53:45 EDT <MrDarcy1815> Well he's 8, so I'm not sure if say well adjusted is the right word. Unless a fascination with burping and breaking wind counts as normal for you.  I can't remember a powercut since the 80s. Suspect no different than internet outages at the office.  1/2
1299314151878209542 2020-08-28 07:53:28 EDT <CuratedbyPamela> I really don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs an accurate way to position this. It‚Äôs not helping him to win at all. It‚Äôs showing that the outage is strong and that sends a clearer message about the level of engagement. In my opinion.
1299314102033100809 2020-08-28 07:53:16 EDT <OpenreachHelp> Hi Fiona, I can't find any outages at Kyre exchange. If the fault has been reported then the provider should be able to offer an update to your parents in-law. I really do hope it can be resolve quickly for them. ^Antony
1299311239617826821 2020-08-28 07:41:54 EDT <JayHadHope> This also ignores that no network has 100% uptime though, especially not home Internet which wasn't intended for full usage all day.  And if an outage or your line gets cut? At least 24 hours downtime.
1299303873300004865 2020-08-28 07:12:37 EDT <yh_crockett> I want to know why @Entergy can't seem to get the power on in Colmesneil, TX. Calling the outage help line gets me nowhere. They just give out bogus estimated information. At 3:00 yesterday they said power would be on by 10p. At 9p they said by 10p the next day. #ENTERGY #outage

1299180688273481731 2020-08-27 23:03:08 EDT <HardTriggerJ> @Xfinity I pay over $200 and wife and I work remotely now but get internet outage EVERY DAY for the past month. Affecting work/business. No way to contact an agent for compensation of hours lost. AT&T may get a call from me soon
1299173555184304128 2020-08-27 22:34:47 EDT <cowboycane> The ‚Äúpower outage‚Äù at Camden Yards to keep Ripken‚Äôs streak going. Because he said he wouldn‚Äôt play that night. Because he found out his wife had hooked up with Costner. ALLEGEDLY.
1299171072974098433 2020-08-27 22:24:55 EDT <kelscohen> @Cascadelink hey there, we haven‚Äôt had internet since 10 this morning. Do you know why? We live at Alley24 apartments and the customer service guy doesn‚Äôt know why we‚Äôre experiencing an outage

1299153776318861317 2020-08-27 21:16:12 EDT <NateLord53> Is @ATT having some sort of outage? TV just went out and restart has not helped. Tried restarting the TV box and router with no luck. What‚Äôs up??
1299147511194480640 2020-08-27 20:51:18 EDT <naty_melt> ....I don‚Äôt need a map on the outages. I‚Äôve been sitting at home for the past 6 hours without power. At this point it‚Äôs hotter in the house than it is outside.  https://twitter.com/entergy/status/1299089339834658822¬†‚Ä¶
1299145817966559232 2020-08-27 20:44:34 EDT <benjivoices> So if things weren't bad enough already here in Melbourne, the storm last night caused a power outage at the main water filtering facility.

1299131703655649280 2020-08-27 19:48:29 EDT <Vindicat0r1> I mean, it is their fault, cause they gave no warnings and apparently don't know when they're turning it back on, despite them saying it was going to be back on at 1:30pm. It literally took me and my parents ~45 mins to even get the announcement that there was a widespread outage

1299112657169969152 2020-08-27 18:32:48 EDT <BeccaWhitnall> Anyone else experiencing power outage in T.O.? (I thought it was just me because we are having some work done at home involving electrical things and figured something had gone wrong until my neighbors volunteered theirs was out.)
1299112075432808448 2020-08-27 18:30:29 EDT <ATT> Hi Patti, we just wanted to check in. Are you still experiencing an outage?

1299108727266725890 2020-08-27 18:17:11 EDT <tiogamom1> Power outage. Can't even cook inside. Going out. Won't be able to watch RNC tonight at this rate.
1299105307843604480 2020-08-27 18:03:36 EDT <SpielbWhalley> Looking at the outage map, and taking screen shots to compare who gets restored first. Noticed Seymour not mentioned with 911 out. The 443 customers that can‚Äôt use generators lost power for about 2 minutes well after the worst passed. Let‚Äôs see if it remains up through the night.
1299104158432231430 2020-08-27 17:59:02 EDT <Melohello> Dear @Xfinity, fix it geezus. The internet outage happened at the most critical part of the meeting. Is @ATT wireless having issues too? My phone is saying slow wireless connection.
1299102762047803397 2020-08-27 17:53:29 EDT <NachoManeNeek> Now I see why Comcast is bad. AT&T internet might be slow and garbage but I never had an outage.
1299095591801286656 2020-08-27 17:24:59 EDT <CBallengerMusic> Over 4 hours without power here! Doesn‚Äôt seem like it‚Äôs really a rolling or periodic outage at this point.

1299089334411329536 2020-08-27 17:00:07 EDT <NiteStar> I feel really bad for them if @EversourceCT  is their utility provider. At least UI is a little better. Not sure anyone beats @ConEdison for storm response. Am kinda new to CT. Didn't know utility providers did NOT give customers reimbursement for food after power outages! üò±üò±
1299088065621680128 2020-08-27 16:55:05 EDT <jacksonhvisuals> Wouldn‚Äôt it be nice if internet service providers reduced your bill by $5 every time a multi-hour outage occured?  F*cking Cox internet has gone down for its monthly outage of at least 3 hours.   This is ridiculous. I have class. I have work.
1299082332649992192 2020-08-27 16:32:18 EDT <PatrioticMrs> Dose anyone have AT&T Uverse? If so, are you having an outage?

1299077544474370048 2020-08-27 16:13:16 EDT <Tom32805327> Solar panels never degrade. They're worse than plastic in landfills and what it takes to make them. And without subsidies they Aren't affordable for most. We have no better efficient energy than oil. Look at the power outages in California. That's "green" energy on display.
1299075175967850497 2020-08-27 16:03:52 EDT <aKeaneMachine> me: man that power outage at the beginning of august was terrible I hope that doesn‚Äôt happen again  nature: haha guess what
1299073777897074688 2020-08-27 15:58:18 EDT <Teirersias> Update:  @Bell hasn't replied to my email or followed up on the open ticket number we have. When the outage first occurred I was at 9GB of usage, it slowly trickled to 11GB. The signal was so weak the Turbo Hub modem couldn't even run a home wifi network.   @CRTCeng
1299071474683310080 2020-08-27 15:49:09 EDT <OGShortyySlim> Cause these outages ain‚Äôt it, boss. Never had this problem with AT&T Uverse ü§î
1299060530305359872 2020-08-27 15:05:40 EDT <seanprzano> I switched to Spectrum because I had to. AT&T didn‚Äôt offer anything fast enough for heavy media upload/downloads for work. When I lived super close to you my internet sucked. Now that I‚Äôm farther from the mountains it‚Äôs not too bad. Still sucks though. Just less outages it seems.

1299026378256351232 2020-08-27 12:49:57 EDT <lucy_haggard> A new school year started online at @SVVSD just over a week ago.

1299010112716255232 2020-08-27 11:45:19 EDT <sammyharlan> I do apologize that my current commissions didn't roll out as quickly as hoped. Between losing most of the week at the beginning of August from a multi-day power outage and my anxiety continuing to get worse it's been real hard getting things done :/
1299008078990499845 2020-08-27 11:37:15 EDT <bradybrewer> So far in this first week of class: Zoom went down, authentication services went down, media platform hosting online videos in LMS went down, and now a campus wide internet outage. Don't know if I should be mad at IT, or go buy them a beer because of the week they've had.
1299006111723532293 2020-08-27 11:29:26 EDT <bruceclarkprof> Yeah, hate this. Especially dangerous online, when an internet outage can take down your exam. At the same time, I find some students won't read material unless there is a test. I have to hope the studying is the learning. . .
1298998454790656000 2020-08-27 10:59:00 EDT <3GavinsMake1> So uhh  Hurricane Laura's up...and it maaay be coming my way  I know that I don't get on here as often as I should, but like, if I'm not on by then, it might be a power outage, at best, or maybe just strong winds.

Second call your staff so no reports of this outage, meaning my 1st call wasn't sent to proper location. This is the second time in 2 days...
1298969871460397058 2020-08-27 09:05:25 EDT <Spawn_CO> I've done that, several times. It does nothing. I can't speak to a customer service rep and at this point your $10 credits aren't enough. You've cost me over $2500 in lost wages due to the outages. This is unacceptable. You can have some high level form of management call me.

1298834242978435072 2020-08-27 00:06:29 EDT <Uncle_Ruff> I haven't eaten dinner at all. In fact, I skipped TWO meals. I last ate at maybe 230pm. Was scheduled to eat next between 5-6pm, but all this shit popped off and there were power outages on my block so I just went out for a bike & run, came back and now here we are. I üíú it.

The edge hasn't spared us wind, rain, and long power outages the last couple times around. I'm not breathing any sighs of relief until at least tomorrow afternoon.

1298768061105876995 2020-08-26 19:43:30 EDT <thehillwitch> @MediacomSupport today was the first day we talked to an agent who didn't chalk our #outage up to the #derecho and actually looked at our modem. So shout out to Dixie for being the only capable employee you apparently have.
1298759723999727617 2020-08-26 19:10:22 EDT <BluebonnetCoop> Speaking for Bluebonnet, we will not take any intentional outages due to the impending hurricane.

1298754397242101760 2020-08-26 18:49:12 EDT <Lilena91> :DD I WOULD LOVE THAT! ...perhaps sometime after Hurricane Laura passes. I don't think I'll be affected all that much, but the most that I expect to happen are power outages. Where I'm at is barely out of the danger zone anyhow...
1298751553822773248 2020-08-26 18:37:54 EDT <angry_ohio> Do they have a plan to enforce non-compliance? This is the outage I'm seeing at my son's college. I've started to pop off & don't know if I shld try to take it up w/ college or elsewhere. Plans are meaningless if you don't enforce. We've shown that we are all not good Samaritans.

1298538540758777859 2020-08-26 04:31:28 EDT <Mal_hans2> I checked the outage reports on AT&T and T-Mobile as well. They're all having problems in what seems major cities  i.e. Denver, Los Angeles, Seattle, NYC, DC, Boston...  I'm calling it now that something VERY sketchy seems to be going on. Can't simply be coincidence...
1298532632188329984 2020-08-26 04:07:59 EDT <KeyllDarree> Thankfully the internet outages across the island haven't caught us at KD. If you're struggling at home remember we have the IT room and wifi throughout the building!
1298500433846116352 2020-08-26 02:00:03 EDT <VodafoneUK> Hey Matthew üëã We don't want you feeling this was as a customer and if there is an outage/issue with your Broadband then we certainly look into this for you. Can you please drop us a DM with your full name & account number/landline so we can take a closer look at this? Danny  https://twitter.com/messages/compose?recipient_id=20678384¬†‚Ä¶
1298500156669808640 2020-08-26 01:58:56 EDT <richabowyer> Feel better now? Don't believe I did defend the abuser? You let your moral outage at the abuse cloud your ability to talk about it.
1298494441339068416 2020-08-26 01:36:14 EDT <Ugbaddd> I don‚Äôt know if there‚Äôs an outage but I don‚Äôt have service at all. I can‚Äôt call and I don‚Äôt have internet.  #TMobile
1298485097188995074 2020-08-26 00:59:06 EDT <_Danka_tv> @Ask_Spectrum these random midnight outages are pushing me more and more towards @ATT
1298467203440947200 2020-08-25 23:48:00 EDT <chocoemo> Basic stuff ready at home in case of power outage. Canned foods I can eat from, plenty of water, and a couple Power banks to keep my phone charged up. If anyone thinks of anything else I should have that I didn‚Äôt list, please let me know here and I‚Äôll grab it while leaving work.
1298464924327383040 2020-08-25 23:38:56 EDT <Kelendal> AT&T is fucking us over in rural west KY. Daily outages stretching for most of the day.
1298462674896867328 2020-08-25 23:30:00 EDT <ch_reese> @pldt @PLDT_Cares @iamMVP should at the very least give us the reason why there was an outage or interruption in the area and not just say that there's a link loss because it is important that people other than their subscribers know why they can't go online for class or work.
1298457139841601538 2020-08-25 23:08:00 EDT <rpointdujourpt> So what happens when I have MAD things to do online and AT&T has a service outage?  Two online tDPT courses. One huge continuing education course. Three mini continuing education courses. A self review of performance for work. I'm going to go out of my mind.
1298452975187353600 2020-08-25 22:51:28 EDT <angelicatx_> PSA ON POWER OUTAGES! As someone how works at an energy company, please DO NOT get mad for the long hold times and if we can‚Äôt give an estimated time of restoration of power. This is expected. Your provider has NO control when it comes to power outages.
1298449889773473797 2020-08-25 22:39:12 EDT <Buchmn> @Ask_Spectrum can you tell me if I'm currently in an outage? The outage site isn't working for me at the moment.
1298433379625586688 2020-08-25 21:33:36 EDT <KatzStats> My son starts his senior year of college tomorrow. It's all distance learning for now. But thanks to the asshats at #PSEG we have no power in #Teaneck #NewJersey. You can't #WorkFromHome with no electricity. Second long outage in a few weeks. @PSEGdelivers @PSEGNews @northjersey

1298432420438368256 2020-08-25 21:29:47 EDT <rpointdujourpt> @ATTHelp Can you help?  I have a red light next to Alarm on my AT&T box. Is there an outage?  I have work to do.
1298427392067739649 2020-08-25 21:09:48 EDT <rpointdujourpt> AT&T has an internet outage right now in LA
1298423183213699072 2020-08-25 20:53:05 EDT <AmyMAcosta78> @CoxComm @CoxHelp @CoxComm What is going on with the Avondale, AZ outage - no notice, no updates, no assistance. Service is desperately needed for work at home and online schooling - where's the transparency?!? It's pretty sad that I have to use an @ATT hotspot...what gives?!?
1298416693891330049 2020-08-25 20:27:17 EDT <_jazzyboo26> Is anyone else having an outage with @ATT üòí
1298405661768847361 2020-08-25 19:43:27 EDT <cinnabaron> Small life update! In the path of Hurricane Laura currently, I doubt it‚Äôll be major other than some rain and maybe some wind. At worst a power outage; so don‚Äôt worry. But if I do disappear that‚Äôs why!
1298404627386445825 2020-08-25 19:39:21 EDT <Freckled_Smudge> @OANN Are you having an outage?  It cuts out during commercial and now its totally down. What is going on over there.  I wanted to see the RNC convention tonight.  Now I have to go over to RSB to view it.  Come on!!!!  ROKU LIVE STREAM IS TOTALLY DOWN! WON'T LOAD AT ALL!
1298403196960944133 2020-08-25 19:33:39 EDT <sjalexander> don't think so. no reason to expect we'd need to; it's really only indicated if you're likely to flood (we're not) or if it's likely to blow your house down (it's not).  The risks are mainly crap blowing thru the air at speed into/through your windows, and extended power outage
1298401255916625920 2020-08-25 19:25:57 EDT <CloudyDay28> @ATT I want my internet back. üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠ Damn outage.
1298401249621147649 2020-08-25 19:25:55 EDT <nspowerinc> Sorry for the confusion, Matt. Regarding the emergency outage in Dartmouth, we called all impacted customers today. If you didn't receive a call, please send us a DM with your contact info so we can update it in our system. The outage started at approx. 8pm & should last 30 mins.
1298398574842003456 2020-08-25 19:15:17 EDT <KingxCmart> Wow, came home from work n there is no power...üò©  Looked at PG&E site n said they don‚Äôt have an ETA when the power will be back on. They are ‚Äúinvestigating‚Äù the cause of the outage....üòí  And today started off really good....
1298379446362267651 2020-08-25 17:59:17 EDT <tjrobotham> lmao a screed against technology dependence from an outage I didn't know was happening at the time because the people affected *weren't dependent enough on that particular tool to make a lot of noise about it*  https://twitter.com/CBCNews/status/1298334468130975745¬†‚Ä¶
1298378287870353408 2020-08-25 17:54:41 EDT <jamesbkennedy> Continued weirdness re: @EntergyMS. I had issues with outage reporter & emails Thursday. Today, a voicemail from an AR number & asking me to call @Entergy at a specific extension that doesn‚Äôt exist.  Customer rep transfers me to a voicemail with no greeting message. Puzzling.
1298369910473740289 2020-08-25 17:21:23 EDT <pmblakey> Agreed. But an outage, of this seriousness in terms of down time, must have financial consequences under the terms of their licence. Isn‚Äôt good enough to say ‚Äúwe‚Äôre continuing to work on it, next update at 8am‚Äù - that‚Äôs just appalling.
1298366522583396355 2020-08-25 17:07:56 EDT <janeshirley303> @ATTBusiness @ATT @ATTHelp There is an outage in my area.  But I can't report the outage because your customer support team tells me there is no outage.

Restarted my modem multiple times, reset it, etc. Can‚Äôt get through to help on the phone. I am located in Bronxville. Can you please help?
1298359975463419904 2020-08-25 16:41:55 EDT <EvanPMann> GOP is so good at running on fear. And it‚Äôs effective. Why don‚Äôt dems do the same thing re climate change? Show Houston underwater, Iowa hurricanes and power outages, CA wild fires, towns being burned to the ground. It would scare the shit out of people because it should.
1298358949083779072 2020-08-25 16:37:50 EDT <__Quavo> 2nd outage within a week, I‚Äôll be looking to switch internet providers promptly @ATT @ATTHelp
1298357588279676932 2020-08-25 16:32:26 EDT <billymac_23> IMO it's not power outages because you'd see similar spread throughout CT. Danbury's surrounding towns remain at <1%. Same across the border in NY. If we were a state, we wouldn't be a hot spot subject to quarantine rules. Folks here just want transparency and honesty.
1298346237058580481 2020-08-25 15:47:19 EDT <FrancesBreedlo5> @ATT Your cell phone outages are making me look elsewhere for service. This happens at least 2 times a week!üñïüñïüñï

Update at 20:12 - Our engineers are continuing with their repairs to the overhead network. With darkness approaching we understand that it can be unsettling to have a power cut. It may help t
1298338799886438402 2020-08-25 15:17:46 EDT <ChizuD_15> @ATT what‚Äôs up with this damn internet outage!!
1298338490497761292 2020-08-25 15:16:32 EDT <MorbTron> Net just went back up this very second actually. So whatever it was, it seems to have been resolved. Didn't take long at all to solve a state wide outage. Hats off to your team. Cheers!
1298335795275862016 2020-08-25 15:05:50 EDT <AquilusAKAStu> They sent me a text yesterday saying they are aware of the outage but don't have an ETA on when it'll be back up. It's also my general area cause the internet at work was also down all day today and last night.
1298334371812909056 2020-08-25 15:00:10 EDT <x_centric> Not naming any names here, but let's just say it wasn't #MicrosoftTeams that had an outage on the 1st day of school yesterday.

1298320212706693120 2020-08-25 14:03:54 EDT <tanzeelhassan> Power restored at most of the areas at the expense of load shedding at those areas where electricity outage didn't occur earlier
1298317985321562112 2020-08-25 13:55:03 EDT <ULLafayette> We haven‚Äôt received any reports of outages. Contact the IT Service Desk at 482-HELP to report what you are experiencing and where you are on campus so they can look into it. Thank you!
1298316638949965829 2020-08-25 13:49:42 EDT <LawrenceGilder> The figures nationally are available in my pinned tweet, but I am unable to fetch the LTLA figures at the moment. I haven't checked but some news broadcasters may have been able to fetch the data before the outage, I will keep a lookout.
1298313968482746368 2020-08-25 13:39:06 EDT <lavieenmortem> Well @ATT seems to be experiencing massive outages in NC right now. Stream is delayed until I can access my internet :(
1298312112704552960 2020-08-25 13:31:43 EDT <Jodiebabs> So you have us on live chat for an hour then give us a number to call if the problem persists. The number doesn‚Äôt connect. Your main phone line is finished for the day and your online support won‚Äôt accept the account number. We‚Äôre looking at a two day outage. Unacceptable.
1298303040060043266 2020-08-25 12:55:40 EDT <Melohello> Here's looking at you @CityOfMemphis as I sit in a newer home with great square footage but devalued because I'm not in say 38104 where the homeowners are older, whiter, and don't have underground power lines so they always have outages if the wind blows over 10mph.

1298297536072097793 2020-08-25 12:33:48 EDT <annabanana47> SIX hours, @Xfinity? Ha! You're fired. Calling @ATT right now. Your weekly outages are costing me work, I can't afford to be let go because you can't keep your internet running.
1298295385530814467 2020-08-25 12:25:15 EDT <KokuaMultisport> @Xfinity @comcast has had  outages in our area at the same time two Tuesdays in a row. The 1st outage was 1 hr 18 min. This one is planned for 4 hrs 25 mins. Doesn‚Äôt feel like an ‚Äúunplanned outage‚Äù when they start at the same time each week.
1298294145677656064 2020-08-25 12:20:20 EDT <DavidScreative> I certainly hope its a soon as possible but not overly optimistic as standard procedure for any problem (even outages) seems to be reset the router and if that doesn‚Äôt solve it then they book an engineer visit at least 7 working days later to check your connection
1298291433904975874 2020-08-25 12:09:33 EDT <AllieStormborn> Ugh @Xfinity, why can‚Äôt you have outages when I‚Äôm at work?
1298286380221706245 2020-08-25 11:49:28 EDT <Stevenkortis> @ppy hey i was wondering if the server outage was messing with ranks and stuff. i've tried refreshing my profile page 10 times and it won't update it shows i have one top play and nothing else ( if you need to look at my profile its  https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10918701¬† )

1298186839233187840 2020-08-25 05:13:56 EDT <BeverleyHon> @Celcom Will you be processing rebates or discounts for today's inconvenience? You didn't even send out a broadcast message to notify of the outage. What you did send at 2.15pm and 3.29pm today was promos for your MEGA plan. Seriously?

1298163415160991749 2020-08-25 03:40:51 EDT <BooksCaptain> @CoxComm and again another stream ruined thanks to your garbage connection. Why don‚Äôt you at least give a few hours notice when there‚Äôs going to be an outage? I wasted my night thanks to you. You‚Äôre an absolute joke and I feel bad for anyone who has your service.
1298155458209996800 2020-08-25 03:09:14 EDT <freshjazifresh> Got back up to check the weather. Looks like not a direct hit at us in New Orleans/Baton Route but power outages still highly likely. I‚Äôm still hoping Laura doesn‚Äôt gain that much strength
1298149738122891265 2020-08-25 02:46:30 EDT <Optus> Hey there Julie, thanks for reaching out. I'm sorry to hear that you have had some service issue as of late. I've taken a look at Normanhurst, NSW and haven't detected any outages in close proximity to the train station (1/2).
1298119322385162242 2020-08-25 00:45:39 EDT <MikeDillonVA> Lightning striking every few seconds outside and pouring rain. Pretty sure our power outage caused something to happen because now sometimes my keys won't work at all for my keyboard, sometimes they work fine...
1298118045622243328 2020-08-25 00:40:34 EDT <peterboie> Just Had my first live stream show have to reschedule because of a power outage on campus. At least I didn‚Äôt have to travel 10 hours to get there!
1298117177258602496 2020-08-25 00:37:07 EDT <Banzai_HB88> I live in California. We can't even keep the lights on.  When your power goes out in a 'planned outage' at 2pm and it's 96 degrees outside, you start to question the competency of those in charge.  And when you can't use more than 55 gallons of water a day, something's wrong.
1298106701388881921 2020-08-24 23:55:29 EDT <GlennCarr6> Here in the UK we don't suffer with outages very often at all. Yet the USAGE of energy from wind tops 20% today and there is still room for more! Do you take issue with intermittent renewables providing a chunk of the energy you use? Clearly its efficient in this manner.
1298096437469700097 2020-08-24 23:14:42 EDT <j_lre> I hope At&T resolves this outage soon it‚Äôs already 8.
1298091248360669185 2020-08-24 22:54:05 EDT <supermajingod> So @Xfinity says that I'm almost at my data limit for this month and I've been using too much of my internet when they've had 2 outages within the same week! Just can't win huh? California's over here burning but you want to burn me...
1298089563328589826 2020-08-24 22:47:23 EDT <blakeluther85> 9:46pm and still nothing. Never seen an outage last this long. I wonder how @Verizon responds to outages?
1298081607698403329 2020-08-24 22:15:47 EDT <TonyTigerTotero> The Cox & Cox WiFi app‚Äôs are helpful you can turn on notifications to alert you of an outage. Me & my son use it he didn‚Äôt have any problems at his house using Cox for school today nor did he get any notifications from the Cox app saying it would be down. @CoxComm @CoxHelp
1298078051293511681 2020-08-24 22:01:39 EDT <faysie1977> @Telstra day 24 of tying to sort out my router outages and all I get are ridiculous excuses if I'm lucky or bumped off to the txt service if I'm unlucky. Even more hilariously my mobile service is with Telstra that doesn't work at home either.
1298077974365863938 2020-08-24 22:01:20 EDT <SpartanDominic> When you continually have outages (I‚Äôm on my 3rd in 3 weeks and I live in a city)- at what point to do provide credits for all of the food that has to be thrown away due to your dilapidated equipment?

1297987137007169537 2020-08-24 16:00:23 EDT <DrewSmithee> Yeah you get the impression that CAISO can handle outages or duck curve ramp. But not both at the same time.

1297894430347845632 2020-08-24 09:52:00 EDT <CommieGIR> Day 4 of @ATT fiber outage, had to go do my work at a coffee shop. Thankfully my kid's e-Teacher was sick today so he doesn't need the internet.
1297886571090391042 2020-08-24 09:20:46 EDT <AngelRTalk> What is the vision here? #BreonnaTaylor was killed for no reason at all. Are we supposed to simply accept it and be like "Well, things happen you know. It's the cost of doing business." This isn't an internet outage, it's a life that was taken due to human error. So what gives?
1297884584978382850 2020-08-24 09:12:53 EDT <thomps0n24> Modem issue. Even after a manual restart. The modem and account isn‚Äôt even two months old. Today it‚Äôs saying an outage with resolution at noon
1297881260744937474 2020-08-24 08:59:40 EDT <MissTatiG> It‚Äôs a zoom outage on the first day of school. Imagine if I wasn‚Äôt home and had to be at work trying to tell my child what to do.
1297879290835398657 2020-08-24 08:51:51 EDT <SeanKyleJ> Yo! I didn't  know you lived here too! Sorry about the rants lol  Kamusta globe sayo? Are there outages too? Or wala at all?
1297877744160845825 2020-08-24 08:45:42 EDT <JohnsonMasinde> Kenya power please attend to apower outage at Bukembe market and adjoining areas covering Administration police camp no power since 1pm. Can't reach the emergency office line at webuye. This is the fifth outage in 10 days we need steady and reliable power supply.
1297872282807934978 2020-08-24 08:24:00 EDT <JumeanRawan> @TMobile I have zero bars to one bar service in my house with constant dropped calls. When I call t mobile customer service it says that there are outages in my area. It‚Äôs been a at least 5 days. This is unacceptable
1297869516119191552 2020-08-24 08:13:00 EDT <boris_zhp> I swear, with the number of days there have been @Ask_Spectrum outages, I've wasted at least 2-3 vacation days. Too bad I don't have any viable alternatives in my area. Internet should be treated as a necessary utility these days
1297858874578472960 2020-08-24 07:30:43 EDT <claritassol> ICYMI: Last week‚Äôs roundup of I.T. and tech news looked at Google‚Äôs service outage, and the possibility that self-driving cars will take to the roads in 2021.

1297815733955698688 2020-08-24 04:39:17 EDT <charlottemercer> @TalkTalk we‚Äôve had an internet outage in my local area since Friday, and today we have nothing at all again. My partner is working from home, but can‚Äôt work because of it....any idea what the fault is and when it‚Äôs going to start working again? Postcode is NR8 5
1297810798644023298 2020-08-24 04:19:41 EDT <the3million> Issues with digital-only proof of status for EU citizens: ‚ñ∂Ô∏èDiscrimination: only 3 in 150 landlords said they would be prepared to do these digital checks ‚ñ∂Ô∏èSystem outage at a critical time ‚ñ∂Ô∏èMore bureaucracy: digital check has many moving parts ‚ñ∂Ô∏èMany can‚Äôt navigate digital-only
1297784490878595073 2020-08-24 02:35:08 EDT <AWS_Snarkitect> We had an outage shortly after a change of leadership at my last org, and I thought "this is a great opportunity to attempt some real incident analysis", and showed up to the call w/ an ATL/BTL. Leadership was bummed when it didn't get them to "1 or 2 causes to act on." ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/
1297774897788264458 2020-08-24 01:57:01 EDT <leeatschool> @Ask_Spectrum What is the cause of the Milwaukee Area Service Outage, and what is an ETA on return to service? "We are working on it" isn't an answer, and we need to know if we are looking at minutes or hours.
1297761083680272385 2020-08-24 01:02:08 EDT <mesjinie> unfortunately üòîüòî and i‚Äôm tryin!! this power outage isn‚Äôt helping at all i‚Äôm gnna just‚Äî üò≠üò≠üò≠
1297749786783776768 2020-08-24 00:17:14 EDT <catcouturier> I sneaked a look at google. ‚ÄúUh, yeah! I mean, I totally knew that! I was just kidding when I said they worked during power outages because they didn‚Äôt require power!‚Äù #oops #themoreyouknow
1297747918779305984 2020-08-24 00:09:49 EDT <BCCwx> If you don‚Äôt have at least one clear weather power outage per summer, are you really living in Huntsville?
1297744664062242816 2020-08-23 23:56:53 EDT <JemenaLtd> Due to a fault on the gas network, Jemena customers in Kelso are currently impacted by an unplanned outage. We don‚Äôt have an estimated restoration time at this stage, however our crews are working as quickly and safely as possible to restore supply.
1297736849952256000 2020-08-23 23:25:50 EDT <ThisOne93> @sprint for the love of god please don‚Äôt get rid of 3G network your shitty lte doesn‚Äôt work when I‚Äôm home, honestly thinking about ditching this shitty cell service and Constance outages and just spending a few more with Verizon at least they are fucking reliable
1297728458584449024 2020-08-23 22:52:29 EDT <ElexiconEnergy> Restored: Outage due to failed equip't in @ClaringtonON affecting PIER #2  BOAT SERVICES  AT THE PORT.  https://elexiconenergy.com/voutages/¬†
1297722733472743426 2020-08-23 22:29:44 EDT <oldmommatajuri> Power outages really affecting internet. Sorry it has become normal to point I can only read books and hope to keep my battery charged so we have a light at night. Candles are expensive and one of my solar lamps went out this week. Might just be battery but I haven't checked.
1297710023443791872 2020-08-23 21:39:14 EDT <Bell_Support> We're sorry to know you're having issues. There isn't an outage of home phone on your area. Have you tried resetting the equipment or unplugging/replugging the phone jack to see if that resolves the issue? If not, please contact our Tech Team at 1-844-...  https://bellcanada.response.lithium.com/portal/conversation/61421548?authentication=1XmA2cn08ysgD-3Oq-Gdi8_ZOA7j-45SkOfwRJyw5L4%3D¬†‚Ä¶
1297691886262587392 2020-08-23 20:27:10 EDT <Jhanelleee> @SouthwestAir I‚Äôve had zero negative experiences with y‚Äôall but today y‚Äôall showed y‚Äôall asses. How y‚Äôall gone have an outage that delayed multiple flights then have the nerve to put mfs on standby !? I was suppose to be home at 3:45 pm. I can‚Äôt get outta Houston until 9.
1297689833914216448 2020-08-23 20:19:00 EDT <GrettMrs> Don't take this lightly! I just went through this at the beginning of the month...power outage for more than a week AND no phone/internet/cable for 16 days!! Rough, but no one was injured, just a ton of damage!! Please stay safe!!! üôèüôèüôè
1297688728329170949 2020-08-23 20:14:37 EDT <fanfare100> Less expensive than a portable generator!  But first find out what the power output is of your alternator to not exceed it.  And then from there you can compute your electrical power budget. But at least your food won't spoil over an extended outage.
1297688072755322880 2020-08-23 20:12:01 EDT <StateFarm> We aren't aware of any current outages.  Have you tried changing browsers?  You can also contact us at 1-800-782-8332 for further assistance with making a payment or troubleshooting the online issue.  - Shayla
1297681531889168384 2020-08-23 19:46:01 EDT <bleaning> Damn, been stuck with an internet outage all day and it won‚Äôt be fixed until [sometime] tomorrow.   Has anyone in #atx tried working at a coffee shop since the pandemic started? I‚Äôd love to find a patio with a decent WiFi signal.

1297668083985850369 2020-08-23 18:52:35 EDT <Imsouthern> We are supposed to be online Thursday at 9 A.M. - 10 A.M. Here's hoping that we won't have power outages for that wi-fi testing day! I also want to wish our other districts the best of luck for remote instruction. We will be certain to have all devices charged ahead of time.
1297664076433305601 2020-08-23 18:36:39 EDT <googledrive> Hi, Sele. The Apps Status Dashboard ( http://google.com/appsstatus¬†) doesn't show any outages at this time. Can you try clearing cache and cookies?
1297662500167716869 2020-08-23 18:30:24 EDT <bwbingham> @Ask_Spectrum another outage. Every single evening. For fucks sake. Why am I paying for internet at home when every time I get home it isn‚Äôt working.
1297657054220496903 2020-08-23 18:08:45 EDT <barakey_wendy> From severe weather to random outages, everyone deals with a power outage at some point. Be prepared with a home generator, because you won't want to be fumbling for flashlights and candles. It's not just a house.  It's a home.  http://insidethemarket.info/27MrEE¬†
1297633855705292800 2020-08-23 16:36:34 EDT <timperrett> If you refactor you‚Äôre entire service graph at once, such that changes are incompatible, then it‚Äôll take an outage to deploy. I don‚Äôt know any production group that would knowingly change all their systems including the contracts at once; it‚Äôs just not operable.
1297612268675502083 2020-08-23 15:10:47 EDT <Jake_WX> Nothing that we can‚Äôt handle. Gusty winds at times, some heavy rain bands, spotty power outages.
1297588646418223105 2020-08-23 13:36:55 EDT <TheRideshareRed> Thinking about @xfinitymobile. Getting really ü§¨ pissed at all these data outages and lags @MetroByTMobile, which surprisingly didn't happen until AFTER your merger with Sprint. What happen to the merger making you "better"??
1297583834448498688 2020-08-23 13:17:48 EDT <succa99> I can't wait until I can be free of AT&T and Comcast. They never know when I have an outage until 2 hours before a tech is to visit.
1297570734114369536 2020-08-23 12:25:45 EDT <Riptide360> Climate change is causing our power outages by creating super hot summers. Transformers on the power poles aren‚Äôt cooling down at night causing them to fail when folks normally at malls and movie theaters turn on their AC.
1297567933233639424 2020-08-23 12:14:37 EDT <yuyushiki_s> sorry for the outage, i didn't notice the bot had stopped! you can let me know if it happens again at @parker6158 . beep beep
1297565156453613574 2020-08-23 12:03:35 EDT <montanasfreddy> Big thanks to our friends at @NB_Power, they got us set up again after a power outage this morning. I won't post a picture of the squirre...I mean, cause of the outage.  pic.twitter.com/L4csYP370f
1297548230859907072 2020-08-23 10:56:20 EDT <ulimuench> Virtual work arrangements have improved life for most white collar workers.

1297537302827343872 2020-08-23 10:12:54 EDT <CommieGIR> Day 3 of @ATT fiber outage. Already maxed out my mobile data doing work...
1297520243754049540 2020-08-23 09:05:07 EDT <Moff_arts> Good evening @KenyaPower_Care  We are experiencing power outage at Kasarani hunters since last evening...a transformer exploded since then lights are dim and we can't any electronics kindly check it out
1297515277546950658 2020-08-23 08:45:23 EDT <firdausmohandas> Yeah, that's fair. I don't blame people for throwing criticism at Bloomsbury, they're well within their rights to do that. But to accept the book (presumably to make money), and then pull back only because people show outage shows an embarassing lack of principles.
1297515035573526529 2020-08-23 08:44:25 EDT <aircond1t1onr> I‚Äôm disgusted. Trying to look at the weather to see what Laura and Marco have done (I live in Texas and getting hit mostly by Marco). And yeah u already know LAURA TOUCHING THE TIP! Marco slapping us straight in the face with a chance we won‚Äôt get f*cked with power outages so I,
1297509821445439488 2020-08-23 08:23:42 EDT <opie124> Your ass will be sitting in dark. Like is currently California for days at a time with no power. Guess who's closest to Meeting Green new Deal California guess who having power outages. Fare as the executives and $ you don't think someone else will make billions what a idiot ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
1297492917951635457 2020-08-23 07:16:32 EDT <Gerjon_> Note that it's not uncommon for aircraft to disappear over the Libya border due to a lack of receivers. However, they commonly pop back up.  No conclusive evidence because I can't prove there was coverage at the time. Maybe Libya had another power outage, who knows?
1297436446001782784 2020-08-23 03:32:08 EDT <Twitch_CesarB> I just had a shit Saturday on me, Truck stalled at me, won't start and my battery died, stuck for 2 hours sweating, got back home, I started streaming for half an hour and then Power Outage for 4 hours, I can't stop crying, I hope it doesn't happen tomorrow üò¢
1297401304617082881 2020-08-23 01:12:30 EDT <KyrieJordan1> @LADWP Can ya'll please fix the power outage affecting 8,000 or call it what it is a rolling black out. It's been 5 hours at this point. We can't see to cook and feed our kids. Thanks!
1297377485810802693 2020-08-22 23:37:51 EDT <NoahIce> Can relate. We just switched to AT&T because @comcast left us without internet for ten days. Ya know what would need to happen for me to understand a ten day outage? Aliens
1297376290618646534 2020-08-22 23:33:06 EDT <JavaIowaResists> @Talk2Windstream are you fucking kidding me? Now the outage isn't supposed to be fixed until tomorrow? My husband lost an entire day of work bec he has to work at home. No internet since Friday morning. Fiber cut but can't fix it? We deserve a refund. #windstream #iowa
1297373520188579846 2020-08-22 23:22:05 EDT <aschneible> @EAHelp I wanted to go back and play Andromeda again.  It's not finding my cloud save.  I am guessing that is because the servers are down.  At least that is what the "Server Status" shows on  http://help.ea.com¬†.  I don't see any tweets regarding this outage. is there an ETA?
1297370502944628737 2020-08-22 23:10:06 EDT <AmyEast_gmph> OMG Nicole. How?  related... at a school info meeting 10 days ago (before our current fires/evacs) someone asked what the plan is for distance learning if we have fire-related power outages like we did 4 full days last fall. School response: ‚Äúwe really don‚Äôt have a plan‚Äù
1297359312801726467 2020-08-22 22:25:38 EDT <Matt_Grubba> The best was the time there was a power outage at Station Square. Stadium, the shops, the Sheraton... all lights out.  Game had already been delayed and didn't resume until about this time of night... maybe later.
1297358898354171906 2020-08-22 22:23:59 EDT <hulu_support> We're sincerely sorry for the frustration, Russ! We aren't experiencing any widespread outages, so if you're still running into trouble across multiple channels, we'd love to take a closer look on the back end with you ‚Äî just give us a call at 1-888-907-0345. We're standing by!
1297347353922469888 2020-08-22 21:38:07 EDT <BaxterBradley> I'm not but there was a cell tower outage in my area, so my cellular service wasn't working, and unfortunately Pok√©mon Go didn't have the features for home play it does now, so while on wifi at home I got 3 Charmander of the whole day, none were shiny. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
1297298361427656705 2020-08-22 18:23:26 EDT <TweetingChop> Absolutely shocking.   Povetkin couldn‚Äôt hit a barn door. He was swinging at air and flagging.   Then wallop. Power outage.
1297294141920104450 2020-08-22 18:06:40 EDT <Arbskywalker> @comcastcares I told you guys 4 hours ago that my cable and internet went out.  Still nothing.  No call to update and the outage map STILL doesn't show an outage at my address.  Come on man

1297291546144972807 2020-08-22 17:56:21 EDT <Jackets64C> Well, not really as I‚Äôm sleeping over at a friend‚Äôs house. If I was at home, I would be sad because Thrustmaster hasn‚Äôt responded to my support ticket. I have a Thrustmaster TMX that died after a power outage. It‚Äôs been two weeks @TMThrustmaster , get it together!
1297287430551359489 2020-08-22 17:40:00 EDT <CollinGrossWx> When you‚Äôre preparing for #Marco and #Laura, don‚Äôt prepare for them one at a time. Take both storms into account. There‚Äôs not going to be a lot of time between the storms to get preparations done, especially if there‚Äôs damage and power outages from the first storm (#Marco).
1297259901367058432 2020-08-22 15:50:37 EDT <_Deadmomalive> @Xfinity acting like your helping, what a JOKE! Im so sick of my service constantly interrupted but DAYTIME PEAK hour work, or your damn outages, is your service that shitty you can't give us our high speed that we pay for, AT&T where are you?
1297255996709109761 2020-08-22 15:35:06 EDT <QListr> So just trying to win an argument at all cost. I don‚Äôt have the context for that statement . Nor do you. Outage is easy. It‚Äôs why we used to execute children. The liberal position would be to gather more info .
1297244415275089920 2020-08-22 14:49:04 EDT <MWoeppel> California, it‚Äôs time to get your shit together. You can‚Äôt have the entire chaos sequence all at once. Pacing is key. We already have the pandemic. Wildfires, poor air quality, and power outages need to wait their turn.
1297237712878141445 2020-08-22 14:22:26 EDT <dm__ricky> We're dealing with a tropical storm or a Cat 1 hurricane. At most, it's just wind and rain. Flooding and (some) power outages will happen. A tornado COULD happen, but most likely won't.
1297233979419000832 2020-08-22 14:07:36 EDT <RayRouse24> Nah it's just experiencing a TNT outage. The rest of the service, which I don't care to use at the moment, is working just fine. This is gonna require a credit.
1297223713696256001 2020-08-22 13:26:49 EDT <Shrewlocke> A power outage took out my internet so I won‚Äôt be able to stream until possibly Monday evening, after I get a technician out here to fix it. Version 3 of my Ultra Moon team will begin at that point.
1297207127870758918 2020-08-22 12:20:54 EDT <MMGHouston> Unfortunately we‚Äôre experiencing some technical difficulties at MMG Houston from a power outage this morning...which explains why your online orders aren‚Äôt getting through.

1297173791127277573 2020-08-22 10:08:26 EDT <mvwin> @ATT avoid ATT U-verse like the plague!!!  We‚Äôve had a network outage for 24 hours...no internet, TV or phone.  Working and schooling ‚Äúout of the house‚Äù are impossible.  Hard to believe that ATT doesn‚Äôt have the resources to fix this immediately! #attsucks
1297166099625074688 2020-08-22 09:37:52 EDT <danteslacie> Ever since converge had that one big outage, I haven't been able to share play at all... But it looks like i can still stream my gameplay.
1297156276334419971 2020-08-22 08:58:50 EDT <jenwagner> Ha! Should have been outage - but perhaps both words are accurate :)
1297141130593734657 2020-08-22 07:58:39 EDT <wfryer> Third prolonged @CoxComm Internet outage at home this week. It‚Äôs a bad pattern.

1297140104306147328 2020-08-22 07:54:35 EDT <HalWatchesTV> You aren't able to look into them at all. I know because I have your phone number and I call every day. There is no information about these daily outages in 91405, just oh I see there is a major outage in your area" and it comes back on in a couple hours.

1297027496018313223 2020-08-22 00:27:07 EDT <Balderd29264974> Interesting fact: AT&T mysteriously suffered multiple outages and  freezes during the Dem convention, especially during Michelle Obama‚Äôs speech. These glitches are rare, and it will be interesting to see if similar problems occur during the Republican convention.
1297019159608356866 2020-08-21 23:53:59 EDT <voodooqueenA> so the admins of my local facebook group are racist, homophobic, and misogynistic (a girl was asking for a translation and they just kept saying "look at the pretty boys") however i can't leave because i live in the middle of fucking nowhere w/ constant power outages
1297008528964689921 2020-08-21 23:11:45 EDT <lingokid> Hey @ATT the internet has been down 3 days. No communication from you about the outage and your app that is supposed to be helpful is NOT helpful. Get in touch or I‚Äôll ditch you as a service provider.
1297006733181755392 2020-08-21 23:04:37 EDT <andreal_lewis> @ATT My service has been down in Houston for three days due to an outage.  When can I expect my services back online? This is beyond ridiculous
1296999227868864513 2020-08-21 22:34:47 EDT <Jobu_Jones> I second APC. Reliable and lots of options. Have them at work and my home theater (can‚Äôt let a little thing like a power outage keep me from my movies).
1296998367310909440 2020-08-21 22:31:22 EDT <utilityreporter> AG-X program capped at 200mw, and 160mw of power just didn't get delivered to APS during a critical time when utilities were asking customers to cut back to avoid blackouts. Would have been major black eye for dereg if there were outages caused by AG-X contracts.
1296980852140912642 2020-08-21 21:21:46 EDT <mikestanley> Nothing like an unplanned power outage at home to help identify where I scrimped on  UPS placement after the last network redesign. Went from ‚Äúno worries - we can stream Netflix on iPads all night‚Äù to ‚Äúwhy isn‚Äôt the WiFi working, Dad?‚Äù

1296963478972854275 2020-08-21 20:12:44 EDT <beccaronee> It‚Äôs was like 4am during a power outage and a guy stabbed someone and tossed the weapon in our backyard! So the police jumped in at 4am and we thought it was a break in. They announced themselves and taped us off and we couldn‚Äôt leave until they extracted the weapon üòÖ
1296958871215509505 2020-08-21 19:54:25 EDT <sonic> No reported outages Chris. I took at look at your account & what happened was our system saw some unusual inbound traffic so it put a temporary block on that traffic while we confirmed it wasn't nefarious. You should be back up now, if not please let us know.
1296957471278366721 2020-08-21 19:48:52 EDT <jimmibean> Internet is down in #casscounty #missouri at&t outage. People are losing their minds. Send help sos
1296956676004773889 2020-08-21 19:45:42 EDT <EversourceCT> Stay far away from any downed wires and call us right away at 1-800-286-2000. Under the power outage menu, choose the option to report something other than a power outage. If you simply stay on the line and don't enter any information beyond this, you'll be transferred to a rep.
1296955097671299073 2020-08-21 19:39:26 EDT <jakem> Internet goes out at 1pm.   I spend 30-45 minutes on a call with @sparklightcares (lol) and they can‚Äôt figure it out. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll send a tech out between now and 5pm.‚Äù   I call at 4:30pm to check the status of the tech, ‚Äúthere‚Äôs an outage in your area.‚Äù  NOW you tell me.  pic.twitter.com/u0rzH99Eys
1296954012713984000 2020-08-21 19:35:07 EDT <AlreadyCensored> Plenty of network tools available to check quality of service issues. @ATT is the worst. DAS network in PHX stadiums? Consider them to be in outage mode, despites $100 millions of dollars. Old boy network contracts. Paid big but don't deliver.
1296950218383142914 2020-08-21 19:20:02 EDT <KimEvonSEIU2015> The more we limit our energy usage now, the less likely it is that we'll face large-scale power outages. Do your part: pre-cool your house at night, turn off lights and appliances when they aren't in use, and keep your thermostat at 78 degrees or higher! #UnionStrong pic.twitter.com/WsGwTBtdfZ
1296943965824983040 2020-08-21 18:55:12 EDT <bob_perlman> I've got a UPS for my computer and another for my modem, but my Sonic service (AT&T Uverse-based) always goes dead during a power outage.
1296941880723345410 2020-08-21 18:46:55 EDT <ramblgy> i hope schools districts are prepared for possible power outages next week. students may not be able to log into classes.  the gulf can't handle two storms at once
1296939832179150848 2020-08-21 18:38:46 EDT <CassieGharnit> @CitiBikeNYC the station at 33rd and 5th Ave won‚Äôt let my code work for any of the bikes and same for another guy here. Is there a service outage??
1296928001121112064 2020-08-21 17:51:45 EDT <gmg_az> Friendly tip:  If you're experiencing outage make sure to call your utility. I submitted online 4 times since last night...no results. I called @10am and they told me i was restored (we weren't). Still w/o power at least there are now repair folk.
1296927217939877891 2020-08-21 17:48:39 EDT <Murtobrien> @ESBNetworks Hi I checked outages. It said mine went out yesterday and wouldn‚Äôt be available until 23. It went out early yesterday morning. Came back at 9 in the evening. Went again today 21(st) around 4 and is still gone. Says just one customer but no one has it around here?!
1296923207212109825 2020-08-21 17:32:42 EDT <djmccue19411> @ATT I actually called 1st time Wed in the PM; they said it was an area outage that was cured by noon Thursday; I've been getting runaround; it was supposed to be turned over to a tech @ 8:11am today; now saying 4:32pm today - is someone covering tech's butt?
1296917440639545344 2020-08-21 17:09:48 EDT <jayxarr> @Ask_Spectrum Consecutive days of area wide internet outages in Van Nuys, CA. Any reason why? Customer Service isn‚Äôt helpful. With school & work at home, internet should be treated as a utility.
1296917039794327553 2020-08-21 17:08:12 EDT <JRobSATB> Whoo hoo!!! Too bad my class got over at 3:15. üôÑ Hopefully Monday will be a better day, but I won‚Äôt hold my breath. What I will do is have alternate lesson plans ready because so far, not so impressed with your infrastructure. Two days of outages during lessons. Fool me once...
1296912409169293312 2020-08-21 16:49:48 EDT <EnigmaDayna> It didn't work for me. Gmail knows this won't work for those of us still without access to any new mail. I have arrived at the conclusion that it is a bot tweeting for Gmail and Google. Hence they are not telling us about the outages.
1296898609989013505 2020-08-21 15:54:58 EDT <dazwold> Loads of us having the same issue but they won‚Äôt acknowledge a wider outage and keep troubleshooting people at an individual basis. Getting really frustrated that there‚Äôs no resolution
1296894398462976000 2020-08-21 15:38:14 EDT <Fuckluck_69> Hey guys sorry I wasn't online yesterday there was an internet outage in my area all yesterday evening and all morning today I will be on tonight sure though after I get done at the sailboat races tonight because I am back up and running . üí¶üí¶üí¶  pic.twitter.com/YyH3aiSjZ7
1296894095718256642 2020-08-21 15:37:02 EDT <saintjabber> There has been a service outage since the morning of 8/19...during a pandemic... while we are trying to work and college from home. Every time I check, the bar moves out. Fuck @ATT  pic.twitter.com/TeNCXPZGJc
1296889314995875840 2020-08-21 15:18:02 EDT <ReesPaz> Apparently there is an outage going on right now or something at Twitter where the pictures ain‚Äôt loading
1296875421737332736 2020-08-21 14:22:49 EDT <JillWestAuthor> Oof, between the earlier outage this week and today's outage, I've not been able to check my students' videos for about 4 days now. Very frustrating that I can't give them quick feedback or push this tool right at the beginning of the semester when I'm establishing our routines.
1296872052209721344 2020-08-21 14:09:26 EDT <Simply__Solar> Solar panels alone won‚Äôt work during a power outage! When paired with solar battery storage, they can.

1296865975719964672 2020-08-21 13:45:17 EDT <Ferrydogmother> I don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶this smacks of a cover story, at least to me.  Why remove and dismantle sorting machines, especially at a time high worker outages?
1296865830010003458 2020-08-21 13:44:43 EDT <CommieGIR> Really enjoying this 12 hr outage, @ATT
1296865415990251520 2020-08-21 13:43:04 EDT <__Quavo> . @ATT the outage was supposed to be fixed by 9am , it 1:43 pm what‚Äôs going on?
1296858943042523137 2020-08-21 13:17:21 EDT <rollinthegeek> Thanks @ThroneOfDice!

1296851308452941824 2020-08-21 12:47:00 EDT <Raymond_Barreto> @SteveBalwin @BalwinProp you guys can‚Äôt manage estates, honestly. Several units at The Whisken have not had power for 3 days!!!! You seriously need to fire MLE. Seems like they can‚Äôt even rewire a plug. Constant outages that are more frequent than loadshedding. Embarrassing...
1296843701314936835 2020-08-21 12:16:47 EDT <Marisnichole_> I went to sleep around 11 thinking that Aubree was going to sleep in like she has been doing. Nah. Jokes on meü§° Edison came to the house at midnight because of a Power outage in the neighborhood and Aubree woke up at 1 and didn‚Äôt go back to sleep until 5am. üôÉüôÉ
1296841781724708866 2020-08-21 12:09:09 EDT <xxWJKxx> @Steve Swensen - Yup, our Xfinity/Comcast cable & 911 voice-over-ip phone service goes dead every time a storm knocks out pwr, the pwr company can't meet demand or there's some other glitch. At least w/the old analog Bell Telephone system we could still call 911 during outages!!
1296839839589916673 2020-08-21 12:01:26 EDT <blairblends> @pingdom do you integrate with pagerduty or other (more aggressive) notification services?  you guys did great at detecting an outage, but it was 0200 and a text notification doesn't wake me up...what would you suggest?
1296839297681829889 2020-08-21 11:59:17 EDT <TimecopMeltdown> I can‚Äôt login at all since last night. Is there an outage or just waiting to send hotfix?
1296836876414988290 2020-08-21 11:49:40 EDT <spinnerbuckle> @ATT is there a landline / cell outage in Louisiana
1296835228577611778 2020-08-21 11:43:07 EDT <CUHSCardinals> Centennial phones are currently out due to an AT&T outage. If you need to reach your student at Centennial please call 530-824-8000.
1296832007553646599 2020-08-21 11:30:19 EDT <PProtoHype> I wish Spectrum wasn‚Äôt the only internet offered in my area. Internet‚Äôs been going in and out for the last 4 hours with no outages or work being done in the area at all.
1296829349342003201 2020-08-21 11:19:45 EDT <edu_tech_lisa> Hadn‚Äôt anticipated a server down today, but at least it‚Äôs back up and running now. If only people would forewarn me before we‚Äôre due a scheduled power outage üò¨
1296818793407229953 2020-08-21 10:37:48 EDT <LADWP> Sorry about that! You should be back on. If you haven‚Äôt already please sign up for our text notifications during outages at  http://LADWP.com/outagealert¬† *JJ
1296817618649845760 2020-08-21 10:33:08 EDT <Sunglar> Yeah... lots of people lost power in the Metro area last night due to thunderstorms unrelated to the storm. Me included. Power outage at 2 am, still hasn't come back.
1296809097237606403 2020-08-21 09:59:16 EDT <mrax4> @ATT Awful service. 10 outages per day and automated system won't let you even speak to a person about it. Don't use ATT Internet service.
1296807920936648705 2020-08-21 09:54:36 EDT <Lorelicious74> Seriously considering changing from @Xfinity to @ATT for internet and TV. Soooooo very sick of outages in my area when I‚Äôm trying to work from home!! Every week!! Gahhhhh!!!!!!!
1296806364325580800 2020-08-21 09:48:25 EDT <TheAmyMariah> Internet outage makes me use my cell phone data which is not cool when I'm at home. Only because I don't have a lot of data left
1296804501660336128 2020-08-21 09:41:01 EDT <Supa_Huskey> I love how as soon as I get in a groove to getting my work queue done, @ATT decides to have a service outage in my area. Been without internet since yesterday and literally cannot do my job lol
1296800202993655808 2020-08-21 09:23:56 EDT <TheSwoleNegus7> Good thing I have PTO for half the day already. At&t decide to have outages on today lol so I'm off until Mondayüí™üèø   I didnt feel like dealing with these folks today anyway
1296797645793632256 2020-08-21 09:13:46 EDT <insideFPL> Good morning. We're sorry you're without power at the moment. If you haven't done so already, please report the outage at  http://spr.ly/6017GmVDf¬†. You can find updates regarding this outage at  http://spr.ly/6018GmVDA¬†. Thank you for your patience.
1296787579258503168 2020-08-21 08:33:46 EDT <FlyLife2016> Lmao. If it starts to look like its going to be serious we're gonna pack up tomorrow and head to my moms in Oklahoma to wait it out. Just don't want to deal with the flooding, power outages and being stuck at home with the newborn.
1296787176441745409 2020-08-21 08:32:10 EDT <Mission_In_Prog> I‚Äôm so sorry for you buddy, I couldn‚Äôt imagine going as long as you have with all your power outages and loss of internet on the daily... I‚Äôd legit go insane... or be at the gym 24/7 cause nothing else to do
1296777015845163008 2020-08-21 07:51:48 EDT <adamnfish> "slight disruption" I have no internet at all, still. It's so slow even DNS queries are failing. There was no communication of long term outage. When will my internet be working? I can't even dial 500 to speak to broadband support, that number just hangs up on me.

1296724215765204992 2020-08-21 04:21:59 EDT <ar_strand> The outage seemed to be about 20 minutes which is probably what it takes to spin up a new boiler at nuclear or fossil plants.  And to your point there wouldn‚Äôt be any excess solar since it is the governors priority to use.

1296710661896986624 2020-08-21 03:28:08 EDT <mr_infern0> @SRPconnect  We had at least two outages within a few weeks. Been without power since 8pm. Won't have anyone power around 5am. Storm is gonr but your workers are working at a snail's pace like there is one and your customer service is terrible.
1296709836478926849 2020-08-21 03:24:51 EDT <whatsuptucson> Traffic lights malfunctioning at Alameda and Granada, and at Congress and Granada. Doesn't seem to be a power outage in that area but the lights aren't working correctly
1296687299195834370 2020-08-21 01:55:18 EDT <TELUSsupport> Hi there, Laura. We don't have any reported outage in this location. Has your mother tried to reboot the device? We would also advise contacting our Client Care team at 1-866-558-2273 and check with them, as well.

I don‚Äôt mind that it takes time. It‚Äôs just their system isn‚Äôt working at all. Power should be on in about an hour.

1296636228570361858 2020-08-20 22:32:21 EDT <WVREDMEAT> I can‚Äôt even begin to tell you all how many times a Cell Site had a power outage that a squirrel caused. As I‚Äôm responding to one, I look at the power poles for a blown fuse, then when I find it, I look for the crispy squirrel.
1296628983526756352 2020-08-20 22:03:34 EDT <TerriGreenUSA> The Democrats are wrong about a lot of things but at least they are consistent about what they believe. Republicans are divided over gay marriage or they‚Äôre silent, which is consent. The church doesn‚Äôt even agree with God, so there you have it. The selective outage is tribal.
1296625974986014723 2020-08-20 21:51:37 EDT <pantyanimal> Virgin doesn't work, look at the tweets & the apologies given for its service. Let alone internet outages, why should anyone be with Virgin? Customers aren't happy, Virgin doesn't listen & more importantly Virgin just doesn't worküëé
1296624382547197952 2020-08-20 21:45:17 EDT <datgrl04> No, it was fine then it just cut me off...no outages that I can see just this note...but like my whole WiFi name is gone I can‚Äôt see anything at all even my modem name went bk to default ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I don‚Äôt see my neighbors WiFi names either ü§î  pic.twitter.com/GAFVghSYDL
1296621219849146372 2020-08-20 21:32:43 EDT <StephenMain99> @ATT @ATTHelp well this isn‚Äôt great. No WiFi all day, and no reported service outages? Well I can assure you @ATT not only is your service pathetic, it‚Äôs not working. Hey @Socket, how do we go about switching to a faster, more reliable provider? pic.twitter.com/dE3qatpxx5
1296618957311541249 2020-08-20 21:23:44 EDT <TheRealJTravers> Do the schedules still run when there‚Äôs an outage, but you just can‚Äôt modify them? My dilemma is whether I should get the Raincloud plus extra valve unit (I need 8 valves) or 2 Bluetooth timers at about half the price. They use different apps, and both apps have bad reviews, LOL.
1296614300816216070 2020-08-20 21:05:13 EDT <debraatnrg> Glad you have one satisfied customer ... I am totally dissatisfied. Over 8 months, $10,000  & still #SemperSolaris hasn‚Äôt  hooked up our battery. 3 cancellations so far & at horrid time with PGE rolling power outages in CA
1296608064297213953 2020-08-20 20:40:26 EDT <agreen> Hey Michael! What sort of troubles are you having? I can probably work with you to figure it out. There aren't any app outages at the moment so I bet it's something simple!
1296599508390940675 2020-08-20 20:06:27 EDT <wvjules1972> @xfinity is there an outage in Swanton, MD?  I‚Äôm at a friends house and don‚Äôt have access to the online account to check for outages.
1296598978587500544 2020-08-20 20:04:20 EDT <LionessEffect> There was an area outage but it says it‚Äôs fixed. But my modem doesn‚Äôt turn on at all - no lights or anything. No matter how many times I‚Äôve unplugged and replugged
1296595339525459968 2020-08-20 19:49:53 EDT <JoaquinFarinas> Honestly, stop asking me to contact you @EntergyLA from this account. I do things according to the law. I don't have anything to say to you or to any of your customer service reps. If I want to tweet at your company during a power outage I will do so. You've made your point. #Bye
1296583560707444736 2020-08-20 19:03:04 EDT <softpeachsam> Im so sad i can‚Äôt be active for thr countdown PLEASE UNIVERSE LET US HAVE A POWER OUTAGE AT WORK BLEASE
1296576036453249024 2020-08-20 18:33:10 EDT <prof_nomis> @Xfinity outages this week = 5 @ATT fiber outages 3 years = 0 Man I miss Fiber.
1296569685505273856 2020-08-20 18:07:56 EDT <RyanJMason> Please draw attn to the power issues in Ca.  We‚Äôve got hi temps, evacuation zones, and rolling power outages at the same time.  Recipe for disaster. 5th largest independent economy on earth can‚Äôt provide ongoing power to the people.  Tech hub of the world.  Cant meet power needs.
1296557255765168138 2020-08-20 17:18:33 EDT <samsaragx> Yes, I was told by a Bell rep over the phone that there is in fact an outage in various areas of Toronto. I'm in North York and was told it could take until August 22nd for them to fix it because at the moment they don't know what's going on :/
1296548143098626049 2020-08-20 16:42:20 EDT <sawyers69> For Pete sake @ATT what's with the crazy long hold time trying to report and outage?? Ridiculous
1296547600041033729 2020-08-20 16:40:11 EDT <IlianaDenise> Why wouldn‚Äôt there be a power outage and canceled class! #2020   I‚Äôm really mad at people who eat BAT SOUP OR WHATEVER!! üôÑ ü¶á üçú #CoronavirusPandemic #virtuallearning

1296544082899214337 2020-08-20 16:26:12 EDT <FucckJoeCecot> Prestinni had an outage lol he didn‚Äôt get hit off. At least I think so

1296522433013350401 2020-08-20 15:00:10 EDT <HeroicSpiritGmr> I really just don't understand. How, why? Why so many things at once? It's almost like I experienced a power outage and it hit all of my devices, except I not only didn't have one, I have UPSs for everything to prevent this exact type of thing anyway.
1296521566927413249 2020-08-20 14:56:44 EDT <CoxHelp> This doesn't look good and I wholeheartedly apologize that you are having an issue with the services. I'm not showing outage in your area at this time. We would need to have a technician come out to take a look at this.  -Xavier
1296509433858547713 2020-08-20 14:08:31 EDT <kevinslo1078> Look at how bad the fires are this year and that is with the power outages I haven't forgotten about those that other people haven't.  Also why do we still have to roller clocks back when 2 years ago we voted with over 60% of the vote to get rid of it do your job
1296502850999255040 2020-08-20 13:42:22 EDT <seanna68> ESB Power outage update now reads Saturday at 1pm! Really folks you couldn‚Äôt make it up üôÑ Ladt minute Staycation sounds good right now.  pic.twitter.com/aKUpcpfaqv

1296490924068020225 2020-08-20 12:54:58 EDT <riskybzns> @sprint @sprintcare @TMobile @TMobileHelp so what was the major data outage overnight in the kansas city metro area that lasted 7+ hours?? sure makes for a crappy night at work when you can't stream anything.
1296490532991111168 2020-08-20 12:53:25 EDT <CinemaStimulus> Oh really? Then explain what there was an outage this morning only for me to get an alert at 10:38am saying it was restore. But I get another alert 10 minutes ago saying it's out again. Yet you don't want to take responsibility for it and reimburse those who work from home. Sad
1296487872640561156 2020-08-20 12:42:51 EDT <Moremiskgaugelo> These people are pathological liars, never believe anything they tweet, they don‚Äôt know what they doing. They busy misusing JHB funds, they benefiting from all these outages at our expense.
1296480974260371457 2020-08-20 12:15:26 EDT <sudip_post> Today I didn't realize about #gmaildown outage until the afternoon when I casually opened twitter and saw it on trending..  goes to show how distant modern workflow has gone from email.   At my workplace we use it very rarely (external communication).. most things happen on slack
1296474047006609409 2020-08-20 11:47:54 EDT <UnrealMikee> I was wrong, this wasn't a planned update, but an outage caused by a powercut. Got confused by the router indicators and by the fact that the internet cut off exactly at 10am.
1296459662108360711 2020-08-20 10:50:45 EDT <RyanPoe85> While @ATT fixes the North Chicago internet outage preventing me from working, I am again struck by how precarious my pandemic existence is. I am a prolonged internet outage from having to risk my life to put food on the table during a pandemic.
1296454843926814725 2020-08-20 10:31:36 EDT <CLPUD> Lakeside - Planned power outage today, 8/20 Where: Areas of S Ten Mile Lake & Templeton Ln When: Today, 8/20 from 8:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. All affected customers were notified by phone.

1296449900662665216 2020-08-20 10:11:57 EDT <DaBXkIdDjoE> Only @ATT would have a service outage in one of the most critical times where most people at home need WiFi. @ATTHelp
1296448426054488064 2020-08-20 10:06:06 EDT <dlnnx> At&T would send me a bill during an outage. Girl fix your shit first. I‚Äôll worry about mine when it‚Äôs time.
1296437041308348417 2020-08-20 09:20:51 EDT <ezequiels> There aren‚Äôt outside speakers... how about a real feature like let me use al that power stored in the battery to power up some appliances at home when there‚Äôs a power outage? ü§î 75Kwh could power up my house for days!
1296436583705567232 2020-08-20 09:19:02 EDT <practice_outlaw> We had outselves a managed power outage last night.  I wasn't loving it but at least it was the middle of the night
1296427990306390022 2020-08-20 08:44:54 EDT <seanna68> So the power outage was set to be cleared this afternoon. It has now been taken off and reissued as a new outage with an estimate of 9pm tonight ü§Ø Such joy üôÑ Days like this I wish I didn‚Äôt have a freezer full from yesterday‚Äôs shopping üõí Still at least it‚Äôs not dark üòä

1296418208879194112 2020-08-20 08:06:01 EDT <PrashantPansare> It is a blessing to have a remote and distributed team across many cities ( and countries) at @airmeet_com in the weather, rain, covid and what not crisis.   can't imagine if this was a single city where all are located and outage happens!
1296415940796715008 2020-08-20 07:57:01 EDT <Danaiwrites> Today I had a ton of deadlines for clients and woke up super stressed to start work at 8:30... only to realize our area had a power outage. Life is determined to teach me that we can't control everything. Maybe I'll even learn this lesson at some point. #Writer #writerslife
1296402867385966592 2020-08-20 07:05:04 EDT <pawnman99> The Air Force has this.  Be careful what you wish for... Now your leave, PCS, TDY, etc are at the mercy of systems coded to only work on Explorer running Flash.  More than once I've wished for a paper form and submit it, because paper isn't subject to network outages.

1296306589205315585 2020-08-20 00:42:29 EDT <FatSlice> People who think that the "green new deal" is great, need to take a look at the rotating power outages in CA - Solar and wind is great until there is no sun and no wind; and then the power simply gets shut off for hours because there isn't enough power to support the usage.
1296299709523353600 2020-08-20 00:15:09 EDT <atomic_startup> When the air is choking, the heat wave is boiling, the pandemic is raging, AND the power is cut and the bandwidth is gone, then I will question my life choices. More.  But power outages probably won't start for a few days, so at least it's better than it will be.  #2020  https://twitter.com/sfchronicle/status/1296233997924802560¬†‚Ä¶
1296297262927081472 2020-08-20 00:05:26 EDT <aaron60060> Sure, but people can walk and chew gum at the same time.  Health care battle doesn't need to stop because of climate change discourse.  This is simple really.  There will be change, or there will be more outage, in perpetuity.
1296296981757693952 2020-08-20 00:04:19 EDT <gaynerdpun> @SCE what are we supposed to do in a planned power outage while caring for a family member in hospice care at home? How are we supposed to keep them alive and safe when we can‚Äôt get them to another location?
1296290905209671683 2020-08-19 23:40:10 EDT <ghtway> No. I don‚Äôt. I‚Äôm explaining the difference at the outage if someone at Starbucks said you can‚Äôt wear BLM and LGBT. But you can wear Trump; Blue Lives, and All lives stuff. Sorry you missed my point.

1296275306995580929 2020-08-19 22:38:11 EDT <cybercodetwins> The power outage and rolling blackouts going out in LA....it was just a matter of time before they pick and choose who doesn't need power at the moment to conserve power. Though this is just gonna make those be more in control of their utilities to get off-grid power.
1296268894206861313 2020-08-19 22:12:42 EDT <NBN_Australia> Hey there. That's just awful and I hope it didn't affect your results.

1296258072051032065 2020-08-19 21:29:42 EDT <tonybmorton> Outages of thermal plants aren‚Äôt exactly rare, and aren‚Äôt the fault of renewables. Likewise, rolling blackouts are hardly a new phenomenon. Longer term, the rollout of storage at scale will likely improve reliability compared with historical levels.

I've heard mixed info on whether modern lines carry power like phone lines used to (I know VoIP service goes out when the power goes out).
1296109763713998854 2020-08-19 11:40:22 EDT <dream_but_wake> By happenstance the outage would happen in the evening or late at night where it is an inconvenience but doesn't stop me from working.

1296086851393064960 2020-08-19 10:09:20 EDT <ElephantEating> Getting back to California - CA could be perfectly fine with the amount of solar it has, fine after shutting down the firm capacity it has, fine without more storage/DR, fine without more imports, etc. It just can't do all of them at once and expect to avoid infrequent outages.
1296084875284365317 2020-08-19 10:01:29 EDT <mind_forset> I hope that I don't get another power outage like that again. "To save energy, it'll come on at 10 or 11pm."  my ass. Lasted more than 5 hours. Most of the night.  pic.twitter.com/IXNdEBTPlR
1296082488876363783 2020-08-19 09:52:00 EDT <jillkolongowski> Also if you didn't know it, most homes and apartments (including ours) in the Bay Area, do not have central AC. And the power company was not prepared, so we've had rolling power outages with little notice, often at the hottest part of the day.
1296078402957578243 2020-08-19 09:35:45 EDT <CountyHire> Shockingly awful weather at the moment, let's hope it doesn't result in any power outages.

1296075723506102274 2020-08-19 09:25:07 EDT <ElephantEating> Ok, I'm going to add my view about the California outages: it should be considered as the outcome of a whole set of decisions at the system level. It isn't too much solar, or not enough firm capacity, or poor DR programs, etc - it's the conjunction of all these decisions.
1296067697369907200 2020-08-19 08:53:13 EDT <Loravara> I thought I received an Email earlier this week saying that BARD would be unavailable on August 19. I didn't look at the outage times.

1296065834239102977 2020-08-19 08:45:49 EDT <suebella> I had AT&T internet service for 20 years and never, EVER had a five day outage.  Had @YourNorthland service for 11 months and have had TWO extended outages!  #fail #worstservice #yougetwhatyoupayfor
1296065707646554115 2020-08-19 08:45:19 EDT <MurderBeeWrote> It‚Äôs my son‚Äôs first day of virtual school and there‚Äôs an outage that @Xfinity doesn‚Äôt expect to be resolved until, at least, 11:30. üôÉ
1296064015668477954 2020-08-19 08:38:35 EDT <alexbloor> I am super impressed with @EquinixUK 's efficiency   at raising invoices/orders.   oh wait you didn't think i meant at fixing power outages? hahaha no
1296063531465478145 2020-08-19 08:36:40 EDT <R2UT3> doesn't show up when I go to website. Maybe they're segmenting certain regions or areas for continued outage, while allowing at least some of their clients to access.
1296057413624369152 2020-08-19 08:12:21 EDT <csuree87> I don't wanna be mean here, but the "modern/western civilized" world needs to step up their game. an east european company provides better services at cheaper prices. And the service record of theirs is a 1 day outage in 3 years. impressive? To put it in perspective. $1 = 4.2 LEI  pic.twitter.com/aMQlDYPzrW
1296048787543273472 2020-08-19 07:38:05 EDT <bozallen> We had some services recover around midday but the main outage for us wasn't resolved until much later in the evening. I guess our rack was just at the end of the queue! Now the fun is over the autopsy begins...
1296035593185566724 2020-08-19 06:45:39 EDT <kmansvelder> Please have a look URGENTLY at Craighall Park. This is the second day in a row where we might have 8 hours+ of power outages in a single day. power outages don‚Äôt even all coincide with loadshedding schedules üò• ref: CPWEB2798607
1296020216275640321 2020-08-19 05:44:33 EDT <RealGeorgOhm> Because people are home instead of at work, the curve up to the peak demand between 4pm and 5pm, looked alot different and the resources weren't managed properly for the ramping off of solar. Couple that with an unexpected outage at a plant and we needed to land shed
1295999155236569088 2020-08-19 04:20:51 EDT <jdpease94> So they won‚Äôt turn off the power but we‚Äôre basically at risk for power outages cause everyone‚Äôs using what they have like crazy ü§ó we‚Äôre in the middle of a heat wave
1295984504360677376 2020-08-19 03:22:38 EDT <citizensrini> @CMOTamilNadu we in velachery face a power outage at least twice a day. Today they have shut it down for maintenance. Don‚Äôt understand what f maintenance is done the. Why the frequent outages? Isn‚Äôt it shameful that a Govt can‚Äôt provide uninterrupted power supply
1295970595499200514 2020-08-19 02:27:22 EDT <Apsattv> It was great to see however what wasn't great to see was all the video disruptions, green screens , breakups and outages. At least half a dozen times the feed got cut. Hope the issue is resolved for the next game.
1295968527535366144 2020-08-19 02:19:09 EDT <JohnGLake4> Are you sure you didn't order LADWP to shutoff power in household that are not wearing masks at home under the pretense that you are rotating power outage to conserve energy?
1295963354129788928 2020-08-19 01:58:36 EDT <michaelvc57> @ATT Hey we are still in the middle of a pandemic. Power outages across the county and your piling on additional data charges right and left wherever you can.  Nice job!
1295963134528589825 2020-08-19 01:57:43 EDT <SirFisch> Today was the first time I recall SDGE mentioning precooling.  I just set the Nest at 74 or 75 through this heatwave.  At some point the grid infrastructure here needs rebuilding. No outages yet, but this isn‚Äôt even a terrible heat wave. Grid isn‚Äôt ready for prime time.
1295956031000809472 2020-08-19 01:29:30 EDT <sunboxlabs> Don't get caught in a pg&e power outage. Get a small or large kit to keep your meat frozen and your back cool at  http://sunboxlabs.com¬†. Unlike gas generators, you can run them indoors!
1295949419985227783 2020-08-19 01:03:13 EDT <Pellz93> Who doesn't love a surprise power outage when you're trying to study late at night @nationalgridus good to see it's not on the outage map and the reporting tool isn't working. Glad we pay the bullshit rates for bullshit service
1295945445282390016 2020-08-19 00:47:26 EDT <__KierraMariee> @Xfinity y‚Äôall having to many internet outages for me @ATT would NEVEEERRR üôÑü•¥

1295925894301638656 2020-08-18 23:29:44 EDT <_stay_black> Should the goal be to afford to live in a neighborhood where my power isn‚Äôt shut off during the rolling power outages? They say it‚Äôs from 3pm-10pm but my shit shuts off starting at 12pm-1am
1295919812229468160 2020-08-18 23:05:34 EDT <datboiTinny> My favorite thing to do during power outage is watch people demand power as they burn more. Not that LADWP isn't at fault at all, but still funny  https://twitter.com/LADWP/status/1295870859886776320¬†‚Ä¶
1295917784937795585 2020-08-18 22:57:31 EDT <claaudiaamezaa> omg yes hella people complain that they don‚Äôt get service at my house or it just lags my phone works and off WiFi too which is weird idküòï  but these fucking power outages got me so fucked up üò©
1295915053867077632 2020-08-18 22:46:40 EDT <bumblesnot> It was a scorcher here today and still around 96 degrees here at 7:30pm! We kept cool and (thankfully) didn‚Äôt have a rotating outage in our neighborhood.

1295905495958528000 2020-08-18 22:08:41 EDT <cocorococo13> If power hasn't gone out at the estimated time per the rotating outage block, does that mean it won't happen? In our case, 7 pm.
1295905474374537217 2020-08-18 22:08:36 EDT <Globetrvlr2pnt0> Cause it doesn‚Äôt work. Look up the numbers for green energy being used in AB and it‚Äôs below 10% Look at California right now using green. Power outages
1295904292935786496 2020-08-18 22:03:54 EDT <apsFYI> @BitchNHeels Hi there. At this time, we are maintaining power for all of our customers. Please check  http://aps.com/outagemap¬† for a list of known outages. If your outage isn‚Äôt listed, you can report it there. Thank you!
1295899295221243904 2020-08-18 21:44:03 EDT <midacre> So @Ask_Spectrum is having an outage in Fort Worth and now @ATT is sucking ass because all the people that can‚Äôt use their WiFi are using the cell network directly. Welcome to the fucking future.
1295886236578652160 2020-08-18 20:52:09 EDT <TheBrandonPerry> @ATT I don‚Äôt need any DMs. Just fix the internet outage over Mid Missouri!!!!
1295885512415121409 2020-08-18 20:49:17 EDT <JJ21338337> The 2 day F‚Äôup is bad enough. Then you failed to NOTIFY us of the service outage when you knew there would be problems. I didn‚Äôt have to trade today at all. But you allowed traders to place orders only for the system to crash 5 mins into trading and no way to manage them!
1295885326494269440 2020-08-18 20:48:32 EDT <ohmyachingsushi> Speeds are unreliable, and while we don't have quite as many outages as we had with Cox, this is just ridiculous. Am I in an outage or am I not? Your automated system says I have service, but I'm getting zero connectivity.
1295884404854751232 2020-08-18 20:44:53 EDT <ohmyachingsushi> Gotta love @ATT's shitty internet and their automated phone tree when you try calling customer support that is entirely useless and extremely aggravating.  Your website shows an outage, and while the modem shows there's connection, absolutely nothing is loading.
1295869518548545536 2020-08-18 19:45:43 EDT <ddbaar1> Hope she can help. Isanti County needs a better option badly! We just had an outage yesterday and today that lasted more than 24 hours. Not good for distance learning or working remotely! @CenturyLink @ATT
1295869340013572098 2020-08-18 19:45:01 EDT <JenniferMoniz3> So TODAY....If we don‚Äôt get evacuated by one of at least 3 nearby burning California wildfires, we have been assured of rolling power outages.  Cheers, 2020!  Right on track.
1295868956310306816 2020-08-18 19:43:29 EDT <maxfwinter> Can‚Äôt wait for my power outage during prime time at the convention
1295867752238858240 2020-08-18 19:38:42 EDT <LivLibrary> POSTPONED! As if a pandemic isn't enough, excessive heat and power outages means the Livermore Encore Players Zoom performance scheduled for tonight 8.18 at 7pm is postponed. Stay tuned for a rescheduled time!  pic.twitter.com/ZfVhMNDFOB
1295867064893075456 2020-08-18 19:35:58 EDT <CraigPaul16> I did not. It hasn't been necessary at all. I've not experienced lengthy power outages. Fingers crossed.
1295864931221348353 2020-08-18 19:27:30 EDT <_steffieweffie_> Exactly. In OC, CA we aren‚Äôt even having a scheduled outage. The power went out at 3:40pm and will be out until 7pm. They are trying to determine the cause if the outage now.
1295862784538877953 2020-08-18 19:18:58 EDT <apsFYI> @michellexo78 At this time, we are maintaining power for all of our customers.  Please check  http://aps.com/outagemap¬† for a list of known outages. If your outage isn‚Äôt listed, you can report it there. Thank you!
1295861188450893824 2020-08-18 19:12:37 EDT <spiffythedog> last time i had a big power outage a friend was like "at least you got to eat all your ice cream before it melted!" & i was like wait you keep ice cream around, & they were like "you don't?!" so i bought some & forgot about it. now ive lost power again and its time has come
1295857596805480449 2020-08-18 18:58:21 EDT <andybrwn> The rolling outages are decided by #CAISO, and its not a grid problem, its a high demand & regional supply issue. Typically the whole west doesn't have record-breaking heat at the same time.
1295857482489720832 2020-08-18 18:57:54 EDT <HeyHanyu2> Thank you for the tips. Before 3pm, I charged up power bank, smartphone and iPad. Also, I downloaed some Midnight Diner shows on @Netflix, music on @Pandora, dinner would be some cheeseüßÄ and crackers. BTW,  we don‚Äòt have AC at home.

1295852266105311232 2020-08-18 18:37:10 EDT <EPCOR> Hello Myra, thanks for letting us know! We're doing some emergency work in the area to repair a valve and conduct hydrant repairs. At this time we aren't anticipating a water outage but we will certainly notify should there be an outage due to these repairs.
1295851186059436037 2020-08-18 18:32:53 EDT <DataCenterDNA> Data center restored doesn‚Äôt imply that all end-user services are up. That‚Äôs the consequential impact of data center downtime. It‚Äôs only good when all end-users are back to same level of productivity as prior to outage. I‚Äôve said it before; we look at downtime incorrectly.
1295848909932236805 2020-08-18 18:23:50 EDT <Sdoots> @CenturyLinkHelp Called about my internet service being down at 8 AM. Was told it was an outage being worked on, estimated fix of 2:08 PM. It's now 5:22 PM. This wasn't really how I saw my day off going.
1295843563087867904 2020-08-18 18:02:35 EDT <Rtonkins74> The blackouts have nothing to do with the fires.  It's the green policies of wind and solar that cannot keep up with demand after the sun goes down.  The grid cannot handle AC at night.  This isn't the planned outage events by PGE and none of those are in effect right now.

1295826692049575936 2020-08-18 16:55:33 EDT <thekenyeung> Comcast outages are nature's way of telling me to move away from my computer, at least for a brief time.   No, Comcast service rep, you don't have to reply to this tweet...yet. I've checked your app.
1295821037305651201 2020-08-18 16:33:05 EDT <Helexan80> If Hover Damn generates enough power for about 1,300,000 homes (not people) how is Las Vegas at threat for power outages. It‚Äôs closest so it doesn‚Äôt lose much in transmission. We are the community damaged by it (look at lake mead) why should we be punished with blackouts?

Tree service that the electric company uses was out but said they're not working my neighborhood today. At least it's cool. Took a couple bites out of the trees down around the garage but you couldn't tell. The wait continues.
1295796700963954690 2020-08-18 14:56:22 EDT <DavePerrino> Don't buy the "Enron" did it story. LADWP made a killing during those events. The market back in 2000 was severely flawed, imports from the PNW were deeply cut due to low hydro and nuclear outages at the time. Fixes have been made. I will need to study what is happening now.

Your store owner directly told us he will not help.
1295777736611573763 2020-08-18 13:41:01 EDT <rebl427> @MetroByTMobile  how can i check service outages when service is down? The only options i can find are to call you,  log in online (need an SMS code), or require it to connect to the network for authentication.....all things I can't do at the moment.
1295777441156235264 2020-08-18 13:39:51 EDT <SatoshiValue> Even if they pushed out code that wasn't tested, they should at least know what they changed and how to fix it.  The initial outage was forgivable, mistakes happen.  But having it continue for a second day without a formal update from @TDAmeritrade @thinkorswim is ridiculous..
1295776702866563077 2020-08-18 13:36:54 EDT <NasseThoughts> Cory, Kevin is right. Your plain wrong, don‚Äôt believe the hype. Look at California! How great is their renewables doing right now? Rolling power outages? Niiiiice lolol
1295772764272504834 2020-08-18 13:21:15 EDT <saket_anisha> @ATT - there has been service outage for past 4 days and all attempts to connect with 611 futile. Dropped DM request and futile too. Is this something that you may please help resolve on priority basis ( its a brand new account :) )
