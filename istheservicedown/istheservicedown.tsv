You'd better believe I'm still getting charged for the outage time and if they want me to believe they have crews out fixing this on New Years Eve then I have beach front property on the moon to sell them...for a reduced price since they're my BFF.

4741448062	2020-01-01T13:46:04	tomekacelestine	istheservicedown	Mailed a priority flat rate envelope of very important military documents from Americus, GA to Porrsmouth, VA on December 17th. The mail left Americus, GA that evening and was never updated again except for on Dec  21st stating that the package was in transit to the next facility and final destination.  I can understand if USPS got overwhelmed with all the mail during the holidays and still have mail sitting at distribution facilities waiting to be processed, but just be honest and allow your employees  to say so!! What's the use of telling customers to track their packages online if you're not going to scan them into the system. I would have greatly appreciated being told at the post office on December 17th that the mail delivery was already really behind.I honestly blame the suits and ties at USPS for probably instructing their employees to keep their mouths shut and not tell customers the truth about all the mail delays in order to keep making sales.  I know how the higher ups like to keep everything from the public in order to protect their company while the employees at the post office that work the window take all the heat and blame from the customers! Yes, I  did send an email for the missing mail and was contacted . It's funny how she couldn't tell me what distribution facility my mail was delivered to on December 17th after it left Americus, GA. Here's my tracking number if anybody at USPS cares#9505511458539351248450. I'm still hoping for the best outcome.

Overpriced for such poor service.

For my $200 monthly payment to Comcast, they certainly should have better service than this!  Their "customer service" is comparable to living in a third world county!!!  I'm a 70 year old senior citizen with bone-on-bone arthritic knees who is strongly opposed to getting her knees cut off.  So this very major issue of mine is, as far as Comcast is concerned, not worth their time.  Why should I be expected to rearrange & reorganize my entertainment system plus grin & bear pain due to my numerous excursions to reset a box that they want me to turn in for another.  NO!!!!  I will lose all of my DVR programs that "they" can't replace due to their lack of past technology utilization & the inability to think beyond the big plan that would benefit their customers. That, combined with the fact that the boxes are made in China. C'mon now, we all know China's manufacturing is one of the major downfalls of our country's economy.  Most of what they mass produce is junk.  It just doesn't last!Comcast penny pinches with their products & even goes further in pilfering funds from us to pay for the ridiculously increasing charges of their notorious Regional Sports fee & Broadcast TV fee. That issue has become so bad that customers have even filed lawsuits against Comcast citing that they are simply using these fees to raise consumer prices to avoid charging higher monthly plan rates. It's clearly a bait & switch ploy.  Comcast already has rights to several of the channels they claim these fees pay for so why are they consistently raising our fees to pay for what they already own? (refer to NBCUniversal's $64 TRILLION paid by Comcast and a buyout of China's (again, China!) Universal China theme park for $6.2 TRILLION).Plus Comcast has now grouped the beloved Turner Classic Movies channel in with the Sports premium plan for $9.99 a month. IF the consumer wishes to continue watching TCM, they are forced to pay the $9.99 charge!. The unmitigated gall of Comcast!  TCM IS NOT & NEVER HAS BEEN A PREMIUM CHANNEL!  NOR IS IT SPORT RELATED!  But the customers cannot get any answers from Comcast as to why they have done this.  We know the real answer is to filch more funds from the ignorant customers (us!).  Will this blatant conglomerate of capitalist thieves never stop?!!!  WHO IS COMCAST KIDDING??!!!  I'm sure that neither the Maryland Attorney General, the FTC and the BBB would consider TCM a PREMIUM SPORT CHANNEL.

I thought it was on my end but after going through the frustration of the troubleshooting steps(at least a dozen times) I decided to check out the forums. It’s so maddening because you don’t know whether or not to call. I just received a new modem last month and I rather get a shot in my eye that have to spend hours on the phone with customer service. Anyone else in the Mart area down?

4744602699	2020-01-04T09:36:54	laozero	istheservicedown	Unbelievable! At USPS Coppell TX 75019 (450 S Denton Tap Rd), now packages delivered by UPS, FedEx, DHL etc have been going missing incredibly several times in a row within a short period of time. It used to be that with the PO Street Addressing Service, these packages were noticed or delivered to you box the very next day once promptly handed off by those carriers to USPS at the dock. Curiously enough, now even though the tracking is well showing that the packages have been delivered and signed for by them, but somehow once you go to pick up they can't find anything and claim that the related packages were not in the container and that they're not able to do something 'til those carriers can bring them! What type of nonsense is this? 1 time, 2 times, 3 times, 4 time in one (1) month for the same addressee, packages are gone missing just like that!? NO WAY! And then, somehow some of them show up days or weeks later out of like nowhere. "Where were these packages in the meantime?" No valid answer at all! What is this? Additionally those newly discovered packages  often have clearly been opened and obviously retaped with different clear tape on top of the original brown seal. This what have happened to me this sole month of December at this location where I used to get this service before without any issue whatsoever. But once, when I did have to argue under frustrating treatment at pickup window with an Asian agent who did not have any PR manners at all when politely confronted about a package that was delivered by UPS more than 2 days then. He started to talk crap with an uncalled for attitude (yes sir - yes sir - yes sir...) and when I asked to see his supervisor, he went to the back and brought a big black guy to talk to me. I almost laughed. But no, it wasn't a laughing matter and I put them straight right there. However the big men did quickly notice something as I spoke and he rather remained courteous contrary to how he tried to initiate the conversation when he came out... Eh, I am black too, not just that big; no pun intended!All in all this month, the lady at the window has found a silly talking point that she keeps repeating over and over again 'to death': "that the packages may have not been in the delivered container". Of course this bull. Something's going on here for sure. And should they don't like handling these partners delivered packages to prioritize their own with USPS tracking numbers (even you'll find that UPS SurePost & other FedEx SmartPost as they do have USPS tracking #s for the last leg, are always handle immediately!) then they should kill this PO Box Street Addressing Service, period. Even more funny as of today January 4, 2020 they are so many USPS (not just temps nor contractors) own employees who do NOT know about this free service which started since 2012. Crazy! Is this also potential for fraud around transit handoff between these two entities? Is it the lack of sufficient qualified personnel?UPS since have been trying to track the location on these packages and still under investigation as I put claims and there over FedEx alike now with the shipper.But now I have an almost equivocal feeling this won't end well and I am ready to take it to another level they haven't seen before if my packages are not found and promptly released. However they have already lost me as a loyal customer and will be closing my PO Box here forever.Before I go, will have to talk eventually to whoever is the Postmaster around here. Very sad, to say the least. When they charge your credit card the payment however always go through 99.9% of the time, never delayed.SICK !

I will continue to post my notifications each day until it is fixed or until I change companies.  I pay my bill according to the agreement between DirectV and myself. I'm holding up to my end of the contract and unfortunately DirectV has not and because of their ability to provide the services I pay they are now void in their contract. Like I said I will post until it's working or until I change.

I'll use the information that you provided.The address to where it was going and my return address were handwritten on my priority flat rate envelope. I even put clear tape across the addresses to prevent them from getting wet and smearing since it was raining that day.The clerk did question the address that I was sending it to that day. I put 1142 N. Carrington Cres, but she did print a label to read 1142 Carrington Cres. N., but she didnt cover my handwritten address.I'm just hoping that they return it back to me at this point. I'll try contacting the post office in Portsmouth, Va to see if they have it there because of the address mishap, but I heard that they never answer the phone.Still hoping for the best outcome!!

4748259053	2020-01-07T14:12:27	None	istheservicedown	AT&T TV streaming service has been down since 1/6/2020 morning. After calling, because phone app wouldn't work, and being placed on hold for an hour and a half, I was told there was an outage in Wichita and they were working on it. I also logged into the chat on my PC and that was a joke. I went through 4 people who had no idea what they were doing or could tell me if there was a problem. This morning, 1/7/2020, I'm in a chat via the myATT app (now working as I reported it also) and have been told "at this moment we have not yet been provided an exact time frame as to when this is going to be resolved due to this issue still being worked on'".  I've asked them to adjust my bill accordingly and suggest every ATT customer do the same! Service just came back on at 8:05am. Switching to AT&T is a mistake! Don't do it. Customer service is horrible. I spent over 15 hrs on the phone with them when installing TVs. Technician had to come out on multiple occasionsas well. I could go on and on...

4748299467	2020-01-07T14:49:28	None	istheservicedown	AT&T TV NOW service (through cable box) went down about 2 pm EST yesterday. After an hour and a half on the phone with three different reps and three different departments, I was finally told that others were having the same problem in my area and the techs were working on it but no estimate of when it would be fixed. It’s now 9:30 AM the following day and Service is still out. I am beyond ticked.  This service is awful.  It’s inferior to the service we had with U-Verse. I’ve made a list of 10 things so far of ways in which it’s inferior to U-Verse. I wish to God I had never switched.

We never get refunded for time lost.  I also do not understand that fact You don't give any Military or Senior Citizen discounts, especially in Florida.

4750236098	2020-01-08T23:08:51	disqus_qnmF3HWaba	istheservicedown	Follow up post to my "No Service" post. I remembered to completely shutoff/power on my phone (aka power cycle) my phone. This forces the phone to re-register on the VzW network which restored service to my phone. VzW most likely had a network issue today ( MME or HSS for you wireless network geeks) to disrupt service until the phone re-registered which clears the issue. I was a Bell Labs telcom engineer that built VzW core networks ( MME/SRS/SGW/ eNobeBs) in the Northeast & Southwest so that how I know.

We have always been in a dead zone although we only live about 2 miles from the old Cell Tower on Armory Drive. So now Verizon has installed a new Cell Tower across the street from my house on Fairview Drive. The antenna is up, lights are blinking on the top of the tower, it has used over 1000Kw of electricity and I still have no service/not bars on my cell phone. Not just my cell phone but anyone that stops by house my has not service, my neighbors have no service either. My cell does not always ring and the calls go straight to voice mail. I still get dropped calls on almost every call that does come though. I have been a Verizon Customer for 20 plus years. Service is only getting worse.

I hate going to the post office counter. First, I have sight issues so filling out forms at the counter is so aggravating. 2nd. The employees always are rude. They don't like their job and seem to delight in taking that out on the customers.  Last year I reported the click and ship issue and the Post mistress "acted" like she never heard it before. Of course....that was as far as the issue went…..

The only time you get the message when you call that there is an outage reported in your area is if they just are tired of taking phone calls. They're useless and assume you're an idiot too. God forbid you ever need to call them. Never tell them you have a router or use your wifi. Ohhhh laaawwd. Just get that internet signal and do the rest yourself.

Optimum takes no responsibility for these outages which have been occurring for weeks here in Smithtown. I estimate 40 hrs plus of intermittent outageswhich are costing consumers big bucks in lost revenue and late charges since bills cannot be paid online.My guess is that someone is doing a DDOS attack on Optimums servers.

I use the term "service" very loosely. For what I pay monthly, this is a major rip-off. Particularly amusing is the fact that one of this company's selling points is that its supposedly underground cable network protects it from being vulnerable to weather extremes, yet it's the first thing to crash whenever there's a brisk breeze or a few drops of water in the area.

So an update.... husband goes BACK to above stated PO, talks to lady at the desk who is super nice, she looks everywhere for it, can’t find it! Post Master comes out, is a jerk my husband said, up to this point everyone has been great, even the guy who hasn’t gotten his boat Prop yet (actually a boat supplier), husband explains everything, blah blah blah haha, Post Master says “well it’s not here”. When asked how he knew for sure since it was never scanned out & also what he was going to do about it he said “well I just know, it’s not here & all I can do is offer an apology.” Per my husband all of this was said VERY crappy. SO he called me (glad it was the calm one of us dealing w/the only butt head 🙄!) & I told him it sounds like obviously it’s still in Logansport like we have all said & I’m sure HE is having everyone look for it or hell maybe someone took it idk! TODAY, miraculously it got scanned into Cincinnati at 446 am, however we don’t see anything where it was ever scanned out of Logansport. Is there a way for you to see when it left Logansport actually? SORRY, but you’ve been so extremely helpful! Just wanting to let the buyer know and well ya know ✌🏼 off mind lol. Thanks for everything! Danielle

It arrived at the Chicago Distribution Center on January 4th. As of today (January 19th) it is STILL in Chicago and there have not been any updates in 5 days... I now have another package that I ordered last week (also first class). Was praying it would stay away from the Chicago area, but WOULDN'T YA KNOW IT! That's where it's been for 2 days with no update. Starting to wonder if USPS just costed me 400 dollars because they can't figure out how to do their job right!

How can you do this to your PAYING costumers!!! What’s the problem? Bad wiring? Over worked workers? Not enough workers? Are the owners of this company using their own product? Was on hols for 1hr 1/2! Held on just to see how long I would wait! I had cooked a full meal before someone answered the call!! Frustrating!!! I wanted to hang up!!!  I didn’t want the run around, just an answer which couldn’t be answered!! Why?? What’s wrong!! Internet down in Westchester since YESTERDAY!!Having a person come to check it out the TOMORROW  I was told! So no internet for 3DAYS and I have a online test I had to take this wked!!!!!!!! I’m fuming! To be told that if any of the cords are not plugged in correctly I would be charged $80???!!!!! If cords not working it’s my problem?!!!! The nerve when I’m being charged for the damn box!!! It’s not the person on the line fault. And I feel for them that they are the ones dealing with customers frustrations. They only can say what they THINK is wrong and protocol. Optimum you suck!

When I was made an inquiry about their “special service” and told their agent that I was not interested then two weeks later I found out that agent changed my plans to more expensive one. I called Spectrum right away to let them know my service was changed without my permission or consent and asked them to switch back to my original service, also wanted to find out that agent who illegally switched my service. However even I was told Spectrum recorded all customers service phone conversations but after many many calls and spoke to more 6 “supervisors” I was told they couldn’t find out that agent and they also couldn’t  switched back to my original plans. Spectrum broke the law by illegally canceling my original contract under Time Warner without my permission.

At first it would connect after a wait of approximately 2 minutes.  As of 10:45 p.m. 1/23/2020 it started skipping in and out. By 11:00 p.m. it would not connect at all. I'm in Brevard County Florida. Really becoming completely disenchanted with this company and its inability to deliver the services it touts.

4768805816	2020-01-24T06:41:44	None	istheservicedown	I work from home in Castle Rock, CO and our internet hasn't been working since 1:00pm this afternoon (it's currently 11:30pm).  I do all my work online and haven't been able to schedule customers, update the database or spreadsheets, check emails, or anything else.  I can use my semi unstable hotspot briefly so it doesn't chew up too much data, but this has been and still is very inconvenient and frustrating.  I have never experienced any company who takes longer to fix their outages or issues than CenturyLink.  This is not the first issue that we've had with internet service either....not by a longshot.  Y'all need to seriously step up your game or you will be out of business in the not too distant future.  We are very dissatisfied with your service.

4769227123	2020-01-24T16:09:36	RBDLA	istheservicedown	I noticed that the Internet was out Wednesday evening upon returning home from work.  Went through the procedure of unpluging the Router and then the modem.  No help.  Thursday evening, I tried completely disconnecting the modem, power cable, phone cable, CAT5, and the Coax cables.  I was hoping the modem would completely power down to see if that would help.  After an hour, the power light was still on solid, and the light below it was flashing.  I reconnected everything, then called Suddenlink.  After listening to and following the instructions of the annoying IVR system, I was finally connected to a human.  Sadly that human was from India, and I had a terrible time understanding him.  He did say that there was an outage in the area and technicians were working on it.  I should wait another 48 hours.  I'm sure this situation will finally end with me having to meet a tech at the house.  He will do something simple to fix it.

Watching the Football play offs last weekend there were several segments of various degrees of pixilation freezing and just going black.  I wish I knew how their system was connected.  I wonder if it is not a problem upstream from the tower toward the network?  I think part of the problems I have of not being able to link to my bedroom TV will be resolved when they do the next upgrade of their Gateway device.

There were four employees standing at the counter doing absolutely nothing. There wasn't a soul in the place. I asked them what the hell was going on. They told me the cable had been cut by what i believe to be Gresham utilities or something like that. So much for precise engineering!!!! Freaking idiots. And XFINITY? Not much better. I called on my cell phone. They had a recorded explanation that basically said they were having problems (DUH) and every time I called...the hour of fix went up by one until the fix time went from 3pm to 10pm. I finally went to bed. The problem with XFINITY is they really have no competition especially in areas like where se live. That has to change because if I had options on any similar quality...Id' sign up today!

Finally call back spend hours on phone to computer and then to India again, rinse repeat. Eventually just got so frustrated that you give up for a few days/weeks. Literally how they string you along and charge ridiculous prices for years. Worse company ever, but has monopoly across large portions of country since gives kick backs to cities.

Media com did an update because all TV channels are now digital. I believe this caused my problems, all the service techs( at least 4+) have me cycle power to the modem and router then tell me that my modem is off put all the lights are illuminated. So I bought a new Modem because the next available Service Rep is 2/12/20 2 weeks out, So I installed a new Modem called Media com gave them the new Mac Address and guess what the same is with a brand new modem. Maybe these techs don't know about the Digital upgrade in my area but someone knows what going on so just be honest and let's get this fixed.

The pages load so slowly it is reminiscent of DIAL UP days.  We have had the SIM card replaced so it's not that.  It has to be the tower and the amount of customers on that tower.  We live 7 miles from the city limits and have clear sight to the ATT tower, but the internet service is slower than molasses... and if I want to watch a movie on Demand??? HAHAHAHAHA     It took me over 3 hours  to watch a 2 hour movie due to buffering.  I have to start the movie, then let it "pause" for half an hour, then I can watch up to 45 minutes before I have to let it buffer again.  ATT can do MUCH better, I am sure!

4779882577	2020-02-01T20:47:44	disqus_H6Nj34b7Ry	istheservicedown	Crappy 4g for over a week and a half all over Beloit Wisconsin.  I opened a ticket but of course it's all good to Verizon.  Also according to Verizon no new tickets are out since 12/19/2019. So all my 5 phone's with two different operating systems are not Verizons fault. The person I just talked to from Verizon refused to open another ticket. This is the type of service I get for 500 dollars a month. Also I'm dropping phone calls and having distorted  phone calls. I have to drive out of my way to a corporate store because a Verizon phone tech refuses to put another ticket in. The first Verizon phone tech was wonderful and put in excellent notes and encouraged me to put in another ticket if I'm not getting the service I pay for. I had good service prior to this so that's why it's such a big thing to me. If they are fixing a tower or updating it that's fine I just want to know this won't be permanent.

This is getting really old and frustrating to say the least like everyone else that has issues with Comcast Efinity Error Code RDK-03033 suggesting I check my connections We get to complain but what good does this do anyone of us with issues? The quality of my Cable has been degrading the previous 2 weeks or more and now today I have only one channel to chose from. The recent weeks the picture quality has degraded to the point it’s hard to watch and it shows up on our recordings also. It’s as though the picture is being scrambled mainly on the faces of characters. For the price of this service I expect the best quality “wishful thinking” of everything from our TV - Phone and internet. Is Xfinity getting ready for the Super Bowl Sunday February 2nd or I don’t watch anyways?  Thank You P.S. Now our remotes will only turn our picture off even after replacing all their batteries and now stuck with not even a pay channel to kind of watch. Thank You from my dog Cooper “WOOF WOOF BARK BARK WOOF

Jitter sits between 20-200ms+ bufferbloat is normally always above 200ms. Cant so anything unless you want to wait like its 56k dialup days. I pay $90 a month for maybe 5 'ok' days of service. I call boost constantly for them to blame it on my device and send me to LG phone repair...like wtf?? Are all you foreign customer service people retarded? I mean non of them even know wth an ip address!!!!?!?!? How the hell do u even work for a phone company?? Got hung up on multiple times because they had no clue how to.solve anything and i ask for a supervisor everytime , only to be transferred to...guess what...LG PHONE REPAIR!!! GTFO and stop toasing customers around because your company blows. Lies and deceit for 10+ years with sprint. Why has no one started a class action lawsuit against them for providing services that are a ripoff.

My tracking info updated that my address was vacan. Not knowing what this meant I emailed USPS customer service and got a response acouple days later. They said that it means that my address isnt registerd for me to recieve mail there. So I sent another email to them letting them know I have been recieving mail and packages for over 2 years but have not gotten a response back. Just saw that another "attempt" to deliver my package was made and another vacant tracking update. On Feb 5th. The thing is Im not working right now and the times the tracking info is saying they attempted to deliver the package Ive been home and the mail person never showed up. Im at a loss on what to do. There will be times where we will go 3 or more days without the mail man showing up at all and its always after 8pm. They really need to figure this out.

It had expected delivery date on February 3.  On the tracking website it shows that they tried to get a signature on February 4, but "Alert" they were not able to get that signature.  Since then, every day it shows that the expected delivery is now the next day by 8 pm, but it still shows the failed attempt for a signature on February 4 as the last time they put anything in the system for that tracking number.  Is my mailing lost in cyberspace somewhere?  I emailed the office of the person I was sending the package to, and the woman who answered my email said they are always open for mail delivery during business hours M-F.  She is going to have someone ask the mail carrier what happened.Meanwhile, I am on a 1-2 hour hold with USPS to try to get some answers from their end.

It would be great if Spectrum would give us a heads up on the situation, but of course they're a shitty company that doesn't say anything. I can't wait for a fiber network to be laid down in the Rogue Valley so I can ditch this crappy company once and for all.

Went through my Verizon data in one day and now getting charged $15/G. Last time this happened, it lasted a week after Hurricane Florence. I don’t link Spectrum has enough assets to manage large-scale outages in a timely manner on the ground and prioritize what they focus on first. Our area seems to be low on that priority list. These outages are becoming more frequent. Anybody have suggestions on how to manage cellular data for streaming and how to watch national news when this happens?

NYS what’s up? Why is this STILL happening years later? Can someone bring another internet service to Syracuse so we don’t have to deal with this bullshit anymore? They are charging above and beyond what any internet service should cost and are providing the lowest speeds possible. We pay for 100 our actual speed has been in the single digits for years. We don’t have cable so we rely on internet for Slingtv and Netflix etc as well as for work. No internet right now and it’s been going out for days but is ALWAYS extremely slow.

4789940353	2020-02-09T22:10:08	disqus_SaNy6sOYFd	istheservicedown	Executive compensation, all of it, would not come near the cost of even a small part of the utilities being put underground.   The cost will be born by the customer, and thanks to state regulations, those customers already pay some of the higher rates.  Green energy mandates, High taxes, regulations on regulations, ban on nuclear energy, subsidized rates for the poor, including millions of illegals, all this adds up to super high electric rates.    Then we have the states incompetence in fire fighting, not that the fire fighters are to blame, but our fire fighting  force  is not big enough, the state did not require sensible fight breaks around populated areas.   Yet PG and E customers get the lawsuit in effect by having to pay yet higher rates.  What should have happened is the stage officials who  dropped the ball on fire preparedness should be tarred and feathered, and all their assets seized.Also not the PG andE has been controlled by the state for decades.  everytime they spend is tracked, budgets authorized, power sources approved by the state, then the state sets the utility rates.      If underground utilities are such a good idea, why did not the state order it, and jack up the utility rate to pay for it?Bottom line is the state has been the one calling the shots at PG and E.    And now some in the state claim that PG and E nerds a state take over!That same inferno could have been started by a tossed smoke, a campfire not put out, a spark from a lightening strike.    The State should have had a better fire plan, mandated fire breaks, pay for a larger airtanker water dropping force on standby, fire proofing building codes, etc....   So sock it to the PG and E customer, and learn nothing that will help stop the spread of the next fire.   State leaders heads should roll for allowing that inferno to spread as it did.  But no, the blame is all heaped on the evil company that keeps my house warm, my lights on and my beer cold.

Called and was given no explanation, apology, offer of credit to account, etc. I guess we might be more understanding here if Suddenlink had ever provided us with reliable internet. It has been, at best, working 50% of the time, when Suddenlink was supposed to be working fine. Now Altice is the owner and has proven to be an even less (if possible) responsible internet provider. Now a good 1/2 of the Silver Valley in Idaho has no tv, no internet, no WiFi...We are a rural area and no one gives a damn what becomes of us. Oh, and our only other choice for internet is filing bankruptcy.

I called my husband exactly 12 TIMES and he had no missed calls on his end.  Great friggin service, cost me money in compensation and a review on our house!  So aggravated right now.

4791165680	2020-02-10T22:09:03	disqus_tATL0xICN3	istheservicedown	Maybe it’s a wake up call to allow Spectrum to overcharge for crap services for a few years instead of U-verse crap.

4791233817	2020-02-10T23:03:17	bryceparsons	istheservicedown	I recently started selling online and therefore started shipping packages often. I decided to go with FedEx mainly because of their rewards system for business accounts. Let me just say that FEDEX IS BEYOND TERRIBLE. Their website never works on my phone, when signed in online i am unable to process shipping labels, and just now (2/10/20 4:59pm Centeral Time) I have called a total of 8 times trying to get customer service on the phone. Their automated system glitches about 6 times before saying transfering you to someone who can help. Then a representative gets on the whole and states they cant hear me. Like not a sound as if I muted my phone. So I thought it was my phone until i made calls to other people and they could hear me fine. So i call back again this time it's a different customer service representative and they state the same thing. WHEN WILL THIS COMPANY GET THEIR SH*T TOGETHER? After this I will avoid FedEx all together even if I have to pay more to go through a different courier. Absolutely ridiculous. They have now stated that they are having technical difficulties for going on three weeks now. Never again.

Can’t watch the tv, or get on phone unless I use my mobile data. They’re beginning to be like Verizon with all these “unexplained” outages. They won’t offer refunds. Verizon sure didn’t, ours was off for a week, they promised to pro-rate it, then ended up charging us extra at the end of that month, it happened 3 times in one month, now this with centurylink. I guess you get what you pay for. Which is bs, $65 for internet service, WiFi, is astronomical. I paid less with cox, and had better service.

4794931025	2020-02-13T18:29:11	disqus_wGO5ZP3OKX	istheservicedown	My business internet has been down today, again. Its a daily thing and has been going on for the last few MONTHS. The equipment is all up to date and running strong. I've had several customer service reps tell me that this area has daily outages, multiple times a day. Some are 5 minutes, while some are 2 or 3 hours if not more. If I shut down my business multiple times a day without warning for sometimes hours at a time, I wouldnt stay in business very long.I am going to call my accounts manager today and see if we can change service providers. Losing service EVERYDAY is absolutely insane!  Everytime the internet goes down, it cost me customers. Obviously none of the money we're paying goes to improving the system. I don't know of any business that could survive with this caliber of performance.

So conclusion is now is comcast going to compensate for there mess up, an #2 I hate how they pretend they cant hear you an your phone is fading in an out , they don't like to hear the truth or be in the wrong but wont fix what we pay for, is this any way fair , I feel we pay comcast to be shut off an put off for a whole day just to turn it back on, Now I am calling the BBB to make this a point of what happen an how they are treating it an customers, an also I,m calling there main office to report the comcast desk people ,there so phony an rude an don't want to get on a real problem when one exist, but jump to nothing when there isn't one, Now does that make sense , Not at all …..I'm loosing money not being able to work thru the internet , will I get compensated for my lost for there mistake??? we'll see...

4798123633	2020-02-16T16:20:13	disqus_mCwbC1v6v6	istheservicedown	We have been out since about 12:30 p.m. 2/13/20.  Contacted Century Link and they said no outages, set up a technician to come out Tuesday.  Contacted my ISP, and they informed me that Century link has an aggregator in Seattle that has a problem, which is where our internet runs through.  Nobody at Century Link seems to know, or they aren't bothering to tell people who are having problems.  There's no way they can come out to my home and fix this.  It's now Sunday, 2/16/20, and still no internet.  It's been going in and out for about 2 weeks, so this is an issue that has been coming on for awhile.  Why do they not have this fixed already?

4801068609	2020-02-18T23:48:18	None	istheservicedown	CenturyLink is a joke. We are in the process of switching and I honestly don’t know what could be better I’m so happy. Parents had it back in the day and switched the xfinity and love it. Me and my roommates at school decided to try century link again because it was the cheaper option for the best service(clearly not) and I can promise you I will never be back and will continually discriminate against this company to anyone thinking of using it. Absolutely horrible all around. Here’s to hoping y’all go out. No more dropped tests and assignments for me, eat my back side centurylink -Cedar City Utah 84720

My biggest problem is not being able to contact anyone at T-mobile in anyway because I am getting a notification that only emergency calls allowed.  I have full bars, my bill is paid current and I have restarted my phone.  Everyone in my house is having thigh problems right now.  I have never had a problem but given that fact that I can find no notification that there are know outages, I cannot contact anybody from T-mobile, and you have created an safety issue for my son tonight that call from Verizon is getting louder.

4809155222	2020-02-25T15:08:38	Maggietish	istheservicedown	Comcast cable TV outage started at 6 AM on Thursday, 2/20/20. Was told by the place that I’m renting that the service would be out until today. No explanation given by Comcast for this 4 day plus outage.  It’s 10 AM and they’re is still no cable TV working. This is an outrage.  Good time for people to consider other cable networks Who respect their customers enough to give them Quick service and viable explanations as to what happened and why Comcast is taking so long to repair it. Comcast policies have always been after 24 hours people get refunds. That was applicable to both Pennsylvania and New Jersey and I’m assuming that’s nationwide policy.

Then they said they can't do anything and are 'waiting on a part'.Newsflash:  It's the year 2020 and we have these amazing things called A-I-R-P-L-A-N-E-S that can fly in the sky and deliver anything, anywhere in the world in 24 hrs.Dear T-Mobile, you're a multi-billion dollar Telecom.....figure it out!!

If WOW is working on its network or has a problem it should email those in the affected area of the problem instead of acting as if the problem is the customer's.
4809642430	2020-02-25T19:21:23	Maggietish	istheservicedown	Is now 2:16 p.m. on 2/25/20 and there is still no cable TV working. The cable TV went out 6 AM on Thursday, 2/21/20. I’m renting and the people that I’m renting from told me that Comcast told them the service would be back on today.. No explanation why was offered. So how much longer are the customers supposed to wait before Comcast gets around to fixing this?  One can understand having a problem but  the lack of communication is not a good business move and is lousy customer service.  This is a wake up call for cable and Internet and phone customers to check out of the companies and see what they have to offer because we’re certainly not getting anything from Comcast except the monthly bill

It feels like Comcast is enjoying profit, but not investing in new equipment. New management would help I guess. In Michigan the network is quite stable though. Why not here in PCB? I used the Xfinity chat support yesterday. Useless. They are telling me after a long time that there is a problem with internet. What a great information!I am trying to work here. Comcast is not fulfilling it’s contract. I am aguest here in PCB, but account holders should stop payment to Comcast.

A reboot of the modem may solve the problem temporarily but then it reoccurs. One of the representatives in business services  I spoke with last week noted some issues but claimed to have no further information.  Usually the reps recommend only that I reboot my modem. This issue has gone on for a week and, interestingly, happened exactly a year ago.   I wish the company had representatives who knew something, or were permitted to know something about or speak of the issues that affect the network.

This means I'm loosing money while you Verizon want me to pay my bill on time $$$.. What's that all about, fraud maybe?? I have had connection issues for about a month..I thought maybe it was my cellphone but not for sometimes later at night it will work,  although very slow to connect.  Headaches from watching that little circle spinning and spinning !! I want a one month credit! Called tech support & was transferred to somewhere in Asia to someone who barely spoke English and really didn't know what they were instructing me to do! And yes it was a 45 minute frustrating unresolved issue!!Should I switch to AT&T?Been with Verizon for atleast 7 years now!?!What's the problem. Fix it or let us know if it is not fixable!! It's the least Verizon can do. Be HONEST & HELP YOUR CUSTOMERS!!!

Our service is still out. My Husband and I first noticed it was out yesterday morning at 6 something before he left for work. The main complaint I have is the fact that I haven't known if he made it to work safe or not... My Husband had an appointment with a Urologist in Rome this morning. When we were going through Trion, Summerville and Rome, We had service. Going through Summerville we had full service bars. But, When we got back to LaFayette, We didn't have any service again.. I hope they get it fixed soon.

I tried to join a match, and it wouldnt let me pick a character, there was a massive delay between entering a message and it appearing in the chat log, locked me out of bought champions and the timer appeared as follows: 5 4 3 2 3 4 3 3 2 1 0 4 3 2 and then it shunted me out, gave me a deserter penalty, and locked me in the champion view page. This happened twice in a row so I doubt it is my console, or internet, and besides the random number thing and random locking out bought champions nothing else happened last patch.

In all that time, tonight is the only time where we're experiencing some issues with the connection. It seems as if it is in fact connected but with super high latency, sloth like download and upload speeds all the way to where it loses connection with the server (or so my iPhone says.) Maybe this is just a temporary hiccup in the WOW Service in the Livonia, MI area or there is actually a problem. It's gotten so bad that I'm to the point of just turning WiFi off on my phone. And before anyone asks, yes I've done everything recommended for troubleshooting.

4823228580	2020-03-06T20:36:20	Maggietish	istheservicedown	What is it with Xfinity/Comcast. They just had over a five day outage two weeks ago for the Cable TV and I believe the Internet was also involved. Here we go again cable TV is out in Claremont. Where I’m renting they said they were told by the Comcast people they’re going to send a technician out hopefully that’s today and not three weeks from now. It’s now 3:30 p.m. and no one has seen the technician yet.   This company has no sense of urgency or customer service. When I find my permanent home they will not be the cable company that I will select by any means. Question: how many people were refunded money on the last outage because their policy is if you don’t have service for 24 hours then they will refund you.

They're notified of service outages by their systems & are quick to bill for services, but don't credit customers automatically when a complete area has no service, usually for hours..disappointing.

4832462866	2020-03-14T06:22:23	None	istheservicedown	Very annoying and can’t find any other problems like this online. What started back up after the outage the problem is rest of my devices WiFi working perfect. But my personal computer keeps getting disconnected and can’t reconnect to WiFi and I can’t access to my router gateway either. My old spectrum free router apparently died from what the chief technician said because apparently he decided to come out to my house his self. Ended up setting up a new one what has router and I’m assuming a modern. I can’t find any info not really know burnet tx that’s well as I only moved there 2 years ago so I do not know the building for the technician is called or it’s number. I work from home as will so this is very annoying.

4833553513	2020-03-15T05:08:42	None	istheservicedown	85050 North Phoenix...Internet issues for weeks now, this is typical for Cox as the infrastructure is so far out of date and in need of vast upgrades. COX has dodged FCC violations with every excuse in the book, first and foremost they blame customer equipment to buy time, then it's routine for COX to send a person to your house to do nothing to buy more time. COX advertisements claim they are the best, that's a lie and it needs to stop. The last visit at my house COX replaces the incoming line from their box to my house for packet loss. COX packet loss is an infrastructure issue and has been an issue for SEVERAL YEARS due to lack of major upgrades to their residential infrastructure. Did I say "Infrastructure" enough, nothing will change folks because COX isn't investing in the correct area of their.... wait for it...... INFRASTRUCTURE!

Get another service provider and if you can’t go eat ya some waaaahhh burgers and some French cries. Ps- I’m a spectrum customer and also get frustrated at times like this but your phone or keyboard or calling customer service won’t get anything done if it’s a black out. Plain Jane and simple. Over all they are good or you wouldn’t keep paying monthly for them. 😂😂 so yeah. Go to sleep.

4836951258	2020-03-17T20:41:35	DJohn1	istheservicedown	The internet and phone were out this morning. Spectrum cannot get to it until tomorrow evening at between 5 and 6 pm. I located the problem and fixed it!The line coming into the sunroom may be defective. I wiggled some wires and it suddenly came back on.The junction into the sunroom is probably the source of the problem.Wiggling the wires re-established the complete connection. A partial connection was enabling Cable TV but not the telephone or the internet.We have some squirrels and other rodents from the woods back of the property that systematically cause problems. My advice would be to put a small pipe around the wire and bury it so that nothing is visible to wildlife in the area. Running duct tape over the wires on the wall will keep any other problems from occurring. Call me. Three houses on Johannsen Avenue, Huber Heights were effected. They should all be up and running now.

The mail left Americus, GA that evening and was never updated again except for on Dec  21st stating that the package was in transit to the next facility and final destination.  I can understand if USPS got overwhelmed with all the mail during the holidays and still have mail sitting at distribution facilities waiting to be processed, but just be honest and allow your employees  to say so!! What's the use of telling customers to track their packages online if you're not going to scan them into the system. I would have greatly appreciated being told at the post office on December 17th that the mail delivery was already really behind.I honestly blame the suits and ties at USPS for probably instructing their employees to keep their mouths shut and not tell customers the truth about all the mail delays in order to keep making sales.  I know how the higher ups like to keep everything from the public in order to protect their company while the employees at the post office that work the window take all the heat and blame from the customers! Yes, I  did send an email for the missing mail and was contacted . It's funny how she couldn't tell me what distribution facility my mail was delivered to on December 17th after it left Americus, GA. Here's my tracking number if anybody at USPS cares#9505511458539351248450. I'm still hoping for the best outcome.

When you contact them they say there is nothing they can do - wait for dispatch. Needless to say, I called FIOS and they are coming next week. 30+ years as a cable vision/optimum customer. Finally it’s  time to let them go. Happy 2020!

This is an issue both at home and at work so cannot be my router as has been suggested. I tried to improve by paying more but this is just a racket. Total replacement of their system is needed. I tried to upgrade my security system but was told I cannot until Suddenlink upgrades in this area.  I’m just praying Frontier comes here soon. I’m switching to another company as soon as possible. Overpriced for such poor service.

You have to call new sales get there employee number so they dont hang up on you and get you a live service tech so you dont get caught up on the automated system to trouble shoot issues

Many phone calls, complaints and no call backs after leaving numerous messages. Now we experiencing constant interruptions on the local channels, pixelated pictures, no tone or nothing at all. I called in several days but it is still not taken care off. To get a technician on the phone is almost impossible, computer generated messages and constant automatic „troubleshooting „. I wished I would’ve not switched over. Our phone service didn’t work for 4 weeks, they offered me $1.00 discount???? We are very frustrated, also the proposed monthly cost are higher then offered.
